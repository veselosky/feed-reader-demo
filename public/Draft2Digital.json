The acquisition unites the industry’s two most innovative and author-friendly publishing platforms into one, enabling the new Draft2Digital to drive even greater success for authors, publishers, and sales partners.<br />\nDraft2Digital and Smashwords are key catalysts behind the dramatic rise of self-publishing over the last fourteen years. Their publishing platforms enable 250,000 authors and publishers around the world to publish, distribute, market, and manage over 800,000 ebooks and 11,000 print on demand paperback books.<br />\nThe combined company will operate under the Draft2Digital name and will be headquartered in Oklahoma City. All Smashwords and Draft2Digital employees are expected to join the combination.<br />\nKris Austin, co-founder and CEO of Draft2Digital, will lead the combined company as CEO. Mark Coker, founder and former CEO of Smashwords, will join the Draft2Digital management team as Chief Strategy Officer and board member.<br />\nBoth companies are entering the acquisition profitable and debt-free.<br />\n“I’m pleased to welcome Smashwords authors, publishers, employees and partners to the D2D family,” said Kris Austin. “Early in our discussions with Smashwords, we each immediately realized we can accomplish so much more for the indie author community by working together than working as competitors. The resources we once expended creating duplicative systems can now be redeployed to ramp up our R&amp;D investments in next generation tools to empower authors and publishers.”<br />\n“I’m thrilled to join forces with Draft2Digital,” said Mark Coker. “Over the last decade, I’ve come to deeply admire Draft2Digital’s team, technology, and commitment to authors. Our shared business model is a key to our two companies’ success. We put authors first. By design, we only make money when our authors make money. This aligns our interests with the interests of our authors. Together we will lead the next chapter of the indie author revolution.”<br />\nThe combination is expected to yield significant benefits for authors, publishers, retail and library partners, and readers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Draft2Digital authors will gain access to the Smashwords Store and its myriad exclusive book marketing tools, including Smashwords Coupons, self-serve merchandising, Author Interviews, and the patent pending Smashwords Presales tool for book launches. Sales at the Smashwords Store have grown consecutively each of the last five years, with December 2021 sales up 20% over December 2020. Draft2Digital’s erotica authors can look forward to expanded distribution enabled by Smashwords’ proprietary erotica certification system, which allows retailers to carry erotic romance and mainstream erotica with greater confidence.</li>\n<li>Smashwords authors will gain access to new tools that simplify print and digital publishing and drive greater success. Among these tools are D2D Print, the company’s Print on Demand service for paperbacks (currently in beta, which authors can join at <a href=\"https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/\">https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/</a>); improved metadata management tools for better book discoverability at retailers; automated end-matter for series books; payment splitting for co-authors and collaborations; and more payment options, including direct bank deposits.</li>\n<li>Retailers and libraries served by the companies can expect greater title selection and unmatched merchandising recommendations. The new, merged company will offer retailers, subscription services, and libraries unprecedented data-driven insights into the world’s largest dedicated catalog of independently published books. This represents a unique and first-of-its-kind offering that Draft2Digital believes will improve the publishing industry.</li>\n<li>Customers of the Smashwords Store can look forward to an improved store experience and an increased selection of books from the many great authors and publishers distributed by Draft2Digital.<br />\n“This acquisition is great news for indie authors,” said Joanna Penn, host of the Creative Penn podcast and bestselling author who has followed each company since its founding. “Two of the industry’s strongest advocates for indie authors are combining their unique toolsets, technologies, and energy to do more for the indie community. There are exciting years ahead!”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What’s Coming Next</h3>\n<p>The acquisition is expected to close on March 1, 2022.<br />\nTo minimize workflow disruption for authors, publishers, and sales partners, the two platforms will combine their systems in gradual and incremental steps.<br />\nAuthors and publishers of both companies can continue utilizing their current platform of choice with the understanding that over time the authors and publishers of both companies will gain access to a common dashboard, common distribution outlets (including distribution to the Smashwords Store for current D2D authors), and an expanded suite of new and improved tools for book publishing, distribution, and marketing.<br />\nDraft2Digital will broadcast a live Q&amp;A session for authors and publishers on Wednesday, February 9th, at Noon Central, with Kris Austin and Mark Coker, moderated by Kevin Tumlinson, Draft2Digital’s VP of Marketing &amp; PR. Kris and Mark will share additional insight about their plans to support the indie publishing community and welcome questions from the audience.<br />\nVisit <a href=\"https://D2DLive.com\">https://D2DLive.com</a> for links and launch time, and to attend live on either Facebook or YouTube. Live questions about the acquisition are encouraged.

The acquisition unites the industry’s two most innovative and author-friendly publishing platforms into one, enabling the new Draft2Digital to drive even greater success for authors, publishers, and sales partners.<br />\nDraft2Digital and Smashwords are key catalysts behind the dramatic rise of self-publishing over the last fourteen years. Their publishing platforms enable 250,000 authors and publishers around the world to publish, distribute, market, and manage over 800,000 ebooks and 11,000 print on demand paperback books.<br />\nThe combined company will operate under the Draft2Digital name and will be headquartered in Oklahoma City. All Smashwords and Draft2Digital employees are expected to join the combination.<br />\nKris Austin, co-founder and CEO of Draft2Digital, will lead the combined company as CEO. Mark Coker, founder and former CEO of Smashwords, will join the Draft2Digital management team as Chief Strategy Officer and board member.<br />\nBoth companies are entering the acquisition profitable and debt-free.<br />\n“I’m pleased to welcome Smashwords authors, publishers, employees and partners to the D2D family,” said Kris Austin. “Early in our discussions with Smashwords, we each immediately realized we can accomplish so much more for the indie author community by working together than working as competitors. The resources we once expended creating duplicative systems can now be redeployed to ramp up our R&amp;D investments in next generation tools to empower authors and publishers.”<br />\n“I’m thrilled to join forces with Draft2Digital,” said Mark Coker. “Over the last decade, I’ve come to deeply admire Draft2Digital’s team, technology, and commitment to authors. Our shared business model is a key to our two companies’ success. We put authors first. By design, we only make money when our authors make money. This aligns our interests with the interests of our authors. Together we will lead the next chapter of the indie author revolution.”<br />\nThe combination is expected to yield significant benefits for authors, publishers, retail and library partners, and readers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Draft2Digital authors will gain access to the Smashwords Store and its myriad exclusive book marketing tools, including Smashwords Coupons, self-serve merchandising, Author Interviews, and the patent pending Smashwords Presales tool for book launches. Sales at the Smashwords Store have grown consecutively each of the last five years, with December 2021 sales up 20% over December 2020. Draft2Digital’s erotica authors can look forward to expanded distribution enabled by Smashwords’ proprietary erotica certification system, which allows retailers to carry erotic romance and mainstream erotica with greater confidence.</li>\n<li>Smashwords authors will gain access to new tools that simplify print and digital publishing and drive greater success. Among these tools are D2D Print, the company’s Print on Demand service for paperbacks (currently in beta, which authors can join at <a href=\"https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/\">https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/</a>); improved metadata management tools for better book discoverability at retailers; automated end-matter for series books; payment splitting for co-authors and collaborations; and more payment options, including direct bank deposits.</li>\n<li>Retailers and libraries served by the companies can expect greater title selection and unmatched merchandising recommendations. The new, merged company will offer retailers, subscription services, and libraries unprecedented data-driven insights into the world’s largest dedicated catalog of independently published books. This represents a unique and first-of-its-kind offering that Draft2Digital believes will improve the publishing industry.</li>\n<li>Customers of the Smashwords Store can look forward to an improved store experience and an increased selection of books from the many great authors and publishers distributed by Draft2Digital.<br />\n“This acquisition is great news for indie authors,” said Joanna Penn, host of the Creative Penn podcast and bestselling author who has followed each company since its founding. “Two of the industry’s strongest advocates for indie authors are combining their unique toolsets, technologies, and energy to do more for the indie community. There are exciting years ahead!”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What’s Coming Next</h3>\n<p>The acquisition is expected to close on March 1, 2022.<br />\nTo minimize workflow disruption for authors, publishers, and sales partners, the two platforms will combine their systems in gradual and incremental steps.<br />\nAuthors and publishers of both companies can continue utilizing their current platform of choice with the understanding that over time the authors and publishers of both companies will gain access to a common dashboard, common distribution outlets (including distribution to the Smashwords Store for current D2D authors), and an expanded suite of new and improved tools for book publishing, distribution, and marketing.<br />\nDraft2Digital will broadcast a live Q&amp;A session for authors and publishers on Wednesday, February 9th, at Noon Central, with Kris Austin and Mark Coker, moderated by Kevin Tumlinson, Draft2Digital’s VP of Marketing &amp; PR. Kris and Mark will share additional insight about their plans to support the indie publishing community and welcome questions from the audience.<br />\nVisit <a href=\"https://D2DLive.com\">https://D2DLive.com</a> for links and launch time, and to attend live on either Facebook or YouTube. Live questions about the acquisition are encouraged.

I&#8217;ve been published for about 10 years, I have about 50 books. Um …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in terms of Apple, have you always been publishing to Apple, and how have you published to Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. So I started off … before Kindle Unlimited, there was KDP Select. And that was not a subscription service, like it is kind of now. And I was selling like mad in there. I just right out the gate was just selling like crazy. So I just stayed on there. And then when KU came, it kind of shifted for me in what I write, in that I found that KU wasn&#8217;t for everyone. I mean, a lot of my demographic, so I decided to go kind of play the field. And I went in, I went and signed up for all the platforms, and just spent the next quite a while like trying to build up readers from all platforms, and go wide. So that&#8217;s my process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m Diane Capri. I write mystery thriller and suspense. I&#8217;m trying to talk loud so I can reach all the way in the back back there. Can you hear me? Yay, okay. I am probably best known for my Hunt for Jack Reacher series, which is a spinoff of my friend Lee Child&#8217;s Jack Reacher novels. But I also write traditional mystery, and I have even one cozy series. And I have some other thrillers as well. I think I have 50-something books, I haven&#8217;t counted them lately. And my entire catalog, not the whole catalog, but most of it is wide. I started in 2011, when there was no KDP Select, and there was no KU. But I still started off with Amazon because I was learning and I had no idea what I was doing. So I decided I would choose one retailer and learn to do it. And then I could figure out what to do after that. So then, starting in about late 2012, I went wide, which at that time was Barnes &amp; Noble. And that might have been all actually, and then Apple came on board after that, and then Kobo after that, and then Google Play after that. So that&#8217;s where I am now, in addition to libraries. And Tulino, I get to through D2D. I&#8217;m in Baker and Taylor and Overdrive for libraries. I also publish in print, paperback, hardcover, large print and audio. So I think at this point, not speaking about my physique, but I believe my catalogue is as wide as you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>04:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is John Wilker. I write primarily space opera sci fi adventure. I have 13 books out and been doing this since 2017. So pretty new to it. I dabbled in KU for the first book for just the one-time three-month window that I was in. Didn&#8217;t really like it, didn&#8217;t do very well. And just then kind of realized that that&#8217;s not how, as like a business standpoint, I wanted to work. I wanted to be as wide as I possibly could be. The controlling piece of me made sure I went direct wherever I could. I even signed up for Google Play, I think like, while I was in KU, because they opened the window briefly where you didn&#8217;t have to be through like D2D or anyone else. So I just signed up, I was like, well, I don&#8217;t know if I really need this, but if they open the door, I&#8217;m gonna jump in real fast. But yeah, so I&#8217;ve been wide pretty much, with the exception of the first few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>05:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you guys. So just to give you guys a bit of a background, and I would like to say, as an author myself, I write urban fantasy, as well as horros. Just wanting to make sure we had a bit of a variety of content here as well, so we can talk about it. So let&#8217;s talk about Apple Books. Let&#8217;s talk about the Apple brand. Let&#8217;s talk about the Apple storefront. Can I just see a show of hands from how many of you actually read ebooks? Yay. No, it&#8217;s true. I just had to ask. How many read ebooks on an Apple device? Okay, great. So, so the folks who raised their hand—and just for the folks at home, we probably have, I think eight or nine people who read on an Apple device, which is pretty good. You probably are familiar with the storefront, the Apple storefront, as opposed to oftentimes we think only of the world&#8217;s longest river storefront as the only place to go. But so you know that there&#8217;s … so what about the Apple storefront, just from a customer&#8217;s perspective, what is it about the Apple storefront that makes it such a unique and we agree that it&#8217;s a very customer-centric experience. But what do you guys find it to be like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in like the page itself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, like how do they do things? And how is it different than that rive place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think well, the page itself, the way that they break things down into categories, super easy. It&#8217;s super easy. Paid top, paid top, free. I can go on and like that, I can know who my competition is, who&#8217;s doing well, what&#8217;s going on, I can find my books real simple and easy. And I also like the colors of it, like the bold color, like they take your book and they make it, I don&#8217;t know, they do something with the colors to make it really stand out over there. And I really like that, they just, I think it&#8217;s very easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>07:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I like is, it&#8217;s very minimalistic, and it&#8217;s very specific, like, you know, the river store. When you go to Apple Books, its books. They&#8217;re not trying to push even their own stuff. They&#8217;re not pushing iPods and you know, laptops on you. It&#8217;s, here&#8217;s books, and they have all kinds of curated categories. And very Apple-like, everything is very heavily curated. Which is kind of, which I like. Like, it&#8217;s not just which thing had the keywords that gamed the algorithm. Somebody looked at and said, I like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>07:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I like about the store is, it&#8217;s actually a store, and it&#8217;s just an Apple store. It comes preloaded on every Apple iPhone, and every iPad. So everybody who has one of those things has the store, which is great. I mean, there&#8217;s something like a billion units or some crazy thing out there, Apple likes to say. So anybody who has an iPhone, which is like a million people, can access the store, which is a great thing, they don&#8217;t have to download an app or anything else. Reading the books on an Apple device in the Apple Store is a very pleasant experience. It looks like an actual book. And when you can flip the pages and the pages kind of turn. And that&#8217;s kind of cool. And it&#8217;s all in color. And it feels more like reading a book. And it&#8217;s easy. The fonts are clean and clear. Apple&#8217;s very picky about, like Cheryl said, the colors, they have a whole color palette, they require a certain type, a certain size, when you upload your cover and all that. They actually physically look at every single book that gets uploaded in the store to make sure that it passes their quality controls. So every book you get looks great. Works great. You know, you can find it. I think it&#8217;s just a terrific app. I really do. And I like it a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. So I want to get into some of the, I know you guys are looking for, you know, what are the specific things you can do to try and increase your chances of discoverability? And when we were talking before this started, there was a really great analogy about the author who just puts their books up and then walks away and thinks, okay, I&#8217;m done. That&#8217;s all I need to do now. I&#8217;m gonna go run Amazon ads now. But so, what are some of the, we were talking a little bit about some of the analogy of, what are the things that are really, really important for the Apple experience? It&#8217;s not just, you put your book up there and yes, they have customers, it&#8217;s going to be featured. But how do you get visibility? There was a really great shopping analogy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you&#8217;re waiting for me to say this, but I like to fish where the fish are, right? So Apple is, I think of it kind of like a store in a mall. So you have your book, and it&#8217;s there. And there are people that are coming to the mall all the time, coming to the Apple bookstore all the time. But they aren&#8217;t necessarily looking at you. I mean, maybe they&#8217;re there to buy shoes, right? And not really, because the Apple bookstore is all books. But maybe they&#8217;re there to buy a book about shoes, okay? But if you want them to buy your book, you have to get their attention. There are things you have to do, you know, and if it were really a mall, maybe you&#8217;d hire a clown to, you know, stand outside and wave them in or whatever. But getting your books uploaded on the store is just like the first step. Then you have to find a way to get those readers who are there, they are coming to the mall, you have to find a way to get those readers who are there to notice you and to buy your book. And that&#8217;s on you. I mean, Apple&#8217;s going to help you because when you upload, you&#8217;re going to list your categories. And you&#8217;re going to have your great-looking book, and you&#8217;re going to pass the quality standards, and you&#8217;re going to be in the right spots. But it&#8217;s on you to bring people to your book and help them find you. And really it&#8217;s like that on all the storefronts. But we&#8217;re used to doing it, as Mark said, on the river store. And we know how. So on Apple we don&#8217;t necessarily know how, but it&#8217;s the same thing. We have to get them to come to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are some of the options or strategies that have worked to get people to go check out your books on Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They really like free first in series. My longer series has a permafree book one. And even when before I kind of learned how to reach out to them, they reached out to me and were like, hey, we&#8217;re doing a big thing. It&#8217;s gonna be on the homepage of the bookstore, free first in series science fiction. Cool to include you in it? Like, of course. And I had people that I know who would like send screenshots like, oh, I was looking for a new book to read, and there&#8217;s yours like on the front page of the carousel on the Apple Books page. So that&#8217;s definitely one, they really like free first in series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, and that was that was a case, just to confirm. Apple reached out to you asking to make a book free that wasn&#8217;t free?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it was free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, it was free already, they wanted to make sure you kept it free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Yeah, that was really the gist of the email. They&#8217;re like, you&#8217;re not changing the price anytime soon?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do want to talk a bit about that. Because when I worked for Kobo, I used to run their self-publishing platform there. That free first in series was a great funnel that I know a lot of people talk about. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily work all that well on Amazon, especially since you only get the five days of free exclusivity. But in all the other stores including Apple, you can make permafree. And the merchandisers love it, because they know that funnel works. If they feature your first book, you probably saw some sales on those two and three, right? They know, the long run is if they can hook the right readers, that&#8217;s going to be a profitable venture. So that is a strategy that works. The other thing I want to kind of allude to, as we&#8217;re talking about this, is preorders are really important on Apple. Can you guys talk a little bit about some of the features or some of the options that are available related to preorders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great thing I think about doing preorders on there is that there&#8217;s flexibility. You can put up for your cover, you can kind of do a placeholder and you can change the date, you can … you know, they&#8217;re really flexible in what they will allow you to do on there with your, with regard to like putting it up and adding stuff to it later or replacing the cover or whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you put up a preorder on Apple, you can put it up for a year. And you don&#8217;t really have to do anything else other than get it ready to release it on time. But people will find it and they&#8217;ll click it for preorder. And then you&#8217;ll have built-in sales when your book releases finally. There used to be kind of a little timeline, and I didn&#8217;t look it up to tell you what it is. But basically I do a one year preorder. And then as soon as I have the book to the point where I can, I put up a sneak peek. And I use usually 50 pages. By this time I have a cover. So I have the cover. I have the first 50 pages at the end, and you know, it&#8217;s not exactly 50 pages but about that many. And then at the end of the sample I put a link to preorder the book. And I call that, they call that a sneak peek on Apple. And they feature those and they use those sneak peeks to help them curate upcoming releases. They use the preorders in the same way. So if they&#8217;re looking to do say, some kind of promotion for cozy mysteries, and Diane has a sneak peek at a cozy mystery that&#8217;s coming up during the promotion period, they might then contact me and say, you know, are you going to definitely do this? And if you are, sort of like with his, you know, can we feature your book? I always say no. So I was gonna say, there&#8217;s a lot of things like that that you can do to sort of get their attention, but you have to be kind of in the pipeline, like Mark said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>15:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna add too, the other nice thing with preorders or just another thing they like to do is, because it&#8217;s on all the iPhones and iPads, they&#8217;ll just send out push notifications and be like, you know, you read this book, and you get those from, you know, an email from Amazon. But this comes up on someone&#8217;s screen, it wakes up the phone and says, John Wilker has a new book out, you read the last one and liked it, want to know more? Then they can tap right on that push notification and go right to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So another thing about the preorders is, Apple is a unique store in that a lot of them have a preview, whether it&#8217;s a preorder or not. And the preview is usually the first 5 or 10% of the book. With Apple, you can customize. If you&#8217;re publishing to Apple Books directly, you can go in and put whatever. So, like, obviously, hopefully the hook at the beginning of the book is good. But maybe you want to tease them, like they can&#8217;t wait to get to that point in the book where something happens. So if you&#8217;re publishing directly, you can put a custom preview, or if you&#8217;re publishing through an aggregator like Draft2Digital, there is a way for Draft2Digital to work with Apple to get that special custom preview for you. So that&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t think … how many of you guys knew about that option with Apple? A few people didn&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think too, and I don&#8217;t remember how the ranking works. But doesn&#8217;t Apple let you double dip on preorders with rank? I think you get rank as your preorder moves. And then on release day, you get again, celebrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, celebrating the realease basically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, which is great. I mean, only Kobo and Apple have that sort of two times bonus in different ways. But that is a really great feature and a question. If it&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;ll just wait to, probably in another eight or so minutes I&#8217;ll just open it up to questions if that&#8217;s okay. Okay. Thank you. We talked about the preview. So we didn&#8217;t talk about something that&#8217;s really important. We talked about the fact that Apple is very much curated, right. So some of the people that I know at Apple have worked in traditional publishing, and that it&#8217;s not just this hodgepodge of everything. It is, they do have a huge catalogue. They can feature audiobooks, and ebooks, too, right? So if you have both of them, they&#8217;re pretty good. The metadata is clear and clean. They&#8217;re pretty good at linking those together. So you can have them. But we talked about Apple as partners. Could you guys expand upon that? The thought of Apple as not just being this platform, but actually being in partnership with the authors that they publish?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>18:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think when we were talking earlier about the build, like, you got to start somewhere on there to build up your platform. And they&#8217;re watching for like, hey, I keep seeing her, this person&#8217;s book or whatever. They&#8217;re watching. Because like, when he was talking about the promos, they&#8217;ll do, they do promos all the time. And there&#8217;s like, maybe like one that revolves around Christmas, or one that revolves around winter, and then they&#8217;re looking to see like, which authors can we include in this? And so if you&#8217;ve, if you&#8217;re doing what you can to like, push things up, like I would say, if you&#8217;re first starting out, and you are … free is good in the beginning, because that is how a reader will pick you up and read you. Because, you know, they&#8217;re not paying anything on somebody that they don&#8217;t know, well, am I gonna like this if I spend six bucks on it or whatever? You know, so you&#8217;ve got to get the reader first and then keep the reader. And so as you start building your platform on there, and your books start getting more visibility, that&#8217;s when you have these opportunities where they work with you more on a personal level. Because they&#8217;re, it&#8217;s like being rewarded for doing hard work on their platform and building and building and growing yourself, and then in turn, that&#8217;s when they&#8217;ll kind of pick and choose, like reach out and say, you know, hey, I noticed you&#8217;ve been doing really good on that, can we include your book?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>19:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want you to demonstrate that you understand, that you&#8217;re a partner with them. You know, you&#8217;re not there expecting them to do something for you. You&#8217;re there expecting that you&#8217;re going to work together with them. So for example, if you&#8217;re running Facebook ads, make sure you have an Apple link in that ad. If you&#8217;ve got your books on your web page and your listing where the books can be bought, make sure you have Apple on there. They look. They do check. They want to know, is this person serious about being an Apple author or not? And some people are not, some people want to just come in and give it a try. And they don&#8217;t want to, you know, be partners with Apple. And those are ones honestly, that generally are not happy and feel like they haven&#8217;t done well. But if you&#8217;re partnering with Apple, it&#8217;s to your advantage to do all these things. And they like it when you do all these things, because then they feel like you&#8217;re working with them. And they want to work with you. And like everybody here, you know, I&#8217;ve talked to these people. And I can say for sure that that is what they are looking for. And that&#8217;s what they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>20:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to that end, they will accept inclusive links. So you have links to Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble and Apple and Kobo and Google and whatever. When you use the logo, if you haven&#8217;t already, update your logo to the Apple Books logo. If it says iBooks, that&#8217;s going to be a little bit of an annoyance that they&#8217;re not going to like that, because they did change their branding a couple years ago. And so be very careful about that. So make sure that it is a logo. You can also use a Books2Read or some sort of universal link, because all they really want is inclusivity. Not exclusivity. They just want to make sure they&#8217;re included, as well. So that&#8217;s the other thing, but it&#8217;s a subtle thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t seen that to be true. I had a bunch of links, and I was using D2D. I had all of the links. And Apple rejected my book because Amazon&#8217;s links were included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You had all the links … si the question was, for the people at home, you had all the links on your website? Oh, in the book, okay, so no, in the book itself. Think about this. I go to Diane Capri&#8217;s party because she invited me, and I start inviting people to go to Jasmine Walt&#8217;s party in the other room. Oh, no, on your website. Yeah, no, no. So a Books2Read link in your book is fine. But if you have links to all the other stores in that book, trying to draw people to a different store from Apple. Oh, yeah. They will reject your book. Thank you for asking that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all the stores will do that. None of the stores will accept that. And it makes perfect sense. I wouldn&#8217;t want that if I owned a store. And you probably wouldn&#8217;t either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, sorry, I misunderstood what you meant by inclusive links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, no, inclusive links on the website. They just want to make sure that they&#8217;re included, as well. So that&#8217;s the other thing as well, I&#8217;m going to do just a little bit of advertisement for Books2Read, we tried to roll this into production yesterday, and had to roll it back, there was like a 10 minute maintenance window where you couldn&#8217;t go and edit your Books2Read. And the idea is that you&#8217;ll be able to change the store priority. So if you wanted to put Apple first because you love Apple, you could do that. Or if you wanted to put your PayHip or whatever. But the whole idea is that if you want to impress Apple, take all your Books2Read links, and put the Apple links first. So that is coming soon. And obviously you can control that on your own website at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are lots of readers in Apple, at least a billion people have access to the store. That&#8217;s a pretty large number of customers out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s more than people in my hometown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine too, actually. More than the dollars in my bank account. So we&#8217;ve talked about how we can partner with Apple. So then did you want to talk about how we can help ourselves there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and that&#8217;s the next thing is, so how can we, how can we take ownership and control? Especially because I&#8217;ll be honest with you. I mean, they contacted John, they haven&#8217;t yet contacted me. I don&#8217;t sell enough. I don&#8217;t have enough play on Apple yet. It is growing slowly. But so, how can someone like me? How can I help myself on Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way that I think is one of the best ways when you&#8217;re just starting out is to find your author people. Like, when she says fish where the fish are with your readers, I think you can fish where the fish are with your authors. You&#8217;re trying to go wide. Go look in your genre. Who do you know that is also on Apple? And you get a bunch of you, get all your posse together. And then you do like some kind of a group giveaway that it is exclusively trying to get readers specifically for Apple. You want to talk a little bit about our [inaudible] that we did?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, sure. So several years ago, we did that, exactly what Cheryl&#8217;s doing. We did it together. John wasn&#8217;t with us then, but next time. And so we had, at that time I think we took 25 authors, and we ran a big giveaway. I think I used King Sumo for it. And everybody in the group, you know, rang the bell and tried to get readers to come on board. And the prize was a paid book, not a free book, a paid book from each of the 25 authors. So each of the authors donated, I think, five books. And so we had five winners who won 25 books each. So it was a big giveaway. And the way we funded it was with the free Apple Book codes that we get.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you get free Apple Book codes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know Mark. With every book you upload to Apple, they will give you 250 codes for free books. Now, the codes do expire. So you don&#8217;t want to just go in and get 250 the day you upload your book, and then think you&#8217;ll give them out, you know, over the next 100 years, or whatever it is. I think it&#8217;s 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s 30 days before they expire. So you want batches, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you want to wait till you&#8217;re ready to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And know how you&#8217;re going to use them, because you just have a limited window. So trying to get your thoughts together on like, what can I do with these to maximize them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can request those if you&#8217;re direct with Apple, right? By emailing the support. You can request them through a distributor like Draft2Digital, and they&#8217;ll request them for you. So you can do it either way. Quick, quick question on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are those codes for you to give to your customer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and you can give them away in a zillion ways. And they will help you get your reviews on Apple, like you can give them to your arc team and ask them to post reviews for you. You can give them out as a giveaway, you know, indicate that, you know, if anybody would like a free book, if you&#8217;d like to review it, you know, you can get your reviews that way. The nice thing is, it applies to any book that you have. So it doesn&#8217;t have to be just your first, or just your free book, or anything like that. So yes, 250 codes, each and every book, any time you want. But they do expire. So that&#8217;s the only thing to keep in mind. Yeah. And it works really well for group promos and giveaways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, it was amazing for us. Like, we were all trying to just grow our readership on there. And it made a huge difference, pooling us all together for one goal, for the one goal in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it really cost us nothing except a little bit of effort. Because the codes were free. And we just, you know, we put it on our websites, we put it on our social media pages, you know, on our newsletters, and that&#8217;s how we got people to do it. And we got a lot of a lot of readers, got a lot of traction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know that people are signing up for that for the right reasons. Because what they&#8217;re getting, they&#8217;re books. And so you don&#8217;t have people that are signing up for your giveaway or whatever that are interested in like a gift card or whatever. These are actual readers, you know they are, because they know that what they&#8217;re going to receive are books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know they&#8217;re Apple Books readers, because what they&#8217;re getting is a code for an Apple Book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you get those when you upload the book? Or do you, anytime you can request them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get them any time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then how many times per book can you request them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>250.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it? So you use 250 and then now you move on to the next book, kind of a thing. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I personally, I would not do that. I don&#8217;t do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you do batches of 10?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well it depends. So in this instance, we had 25 winners. So I requested 25 codes. So you don&#8217;t have to request all 250 at the same time. You could take two. You could take one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could request 250 individual times for one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the best part is, tou can do your promo ahead of it. So it&#8217;s not like you get the codes and then you got a ticking clock. You can do your promo and then request it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so you got 30 days after they give them to you. Yeah, so that&#8217;s an important …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Apple more friendly about giving away free books and getting reviews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving away free books and getting reviews …. You can make the book free if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you mean in the terms of service, like …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you can&#8217;t give away a book and say you&#8217;ve got to give me a review if I give you this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I don&#8217;t think you can do that anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s more of a legality, sort of moralistic thing. However, Apple will not penalize people for having to have a verified purchase. They haven&#8217;t gone in and purged reviews. So when you get an Apple review, you actually get to keep the Apple review. It doesn&#8217;t disappear on you. But that&#8217;s an important thing, because you can work really hard on another retailer, and then the reviews disappear for no rhyme or reason. But if you actually work hard to get Apple readers to review your books, they&#8217;re gonna stay there. I mean, unless there&#8217;s something rebelious or whatever in the in the review, and they go, well, you can&#8217;t say this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, you can&#8217;t … I mean, any child that I know would not be happy if you said to them, you know, here&#8217;s this cookie, but you know, you have to do this first. I mean, it&#8217;s not a quid pro quo. You can&#8217;t do that. But you can give out, you know, you can put every book in your catalog on Apple for free forever if you want to. I don&#8217;t know why you want to do that. But you could. They don&#8217;t …&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can have a free book on Apple that costs everywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, no. So one thing, thank you for that question. One thing about the retailers that a lot of people don&#8217;t realize is, the contract you have with Apple, with Kobo, with Nook, with Google, with Amazon, is you cannot have a lower price on any other retail site. Amazon&#8217;s the only one will come in and kneecap you if your price is lower. I mean, they&#8217;ll usually aggressively auto price match. But all other retailers have that. So if your book is free somewhere, it should be free everywhere. Now, it obviously can&#8217;t be on Amazon if you&#8217;re wide. So then you rely on their aggressive price-matching. But that is one thing to do. So if you&#8217;re dropping the price to zero, you should you&#8217;re bound by the contracts that you should drop them free, or everyone has the right to price match at your expense. So next question right there? No, sorry, one at a time. Questions expire after 30 days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[inaudible] codes US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re geocoded. So you can only give out US codes to US customers. But you get them from all the stores. I don&#8217;t know if you get 250 from every store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you have to request the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You request the geo …? Yeah, that&#8217;s a good, that&#8217;s a good point. But the question is, can you get 250 for US only? Yeah. Great question. Why don&#8217;t we let him ask number two?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s just say, hypothetically, that we&#8217;re distributing on Draft2Digital [inaudible]. How do we go about [inaudible]?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Yeah, if you&#8217;re publishing to Apple through Draft2Digital, you can contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:support@draft2digital.com\">support@draft2digital.com</a>&nbsp;and request the custom preview. You can also request the codes as well. So that&#8217;s as easy as that. There&#8217;s actual real humans, one of which is that the Draft2Digital table this week. Another question right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you were talking about the preorders, Diane, and then you said later you would put your cover up, what are you putting up if you don&#8217;t have the cover for that long preorder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I have the cover, I put it up. Sometimes I have it. Sometimes I don&#8217;t. If I don&#8217;t have it, I put up a placeholder cover, which early on when I used to do this, it was actually pretty ugly. It was just nothing but the right shape, you know. But now what I have is, I have all my branding, but no art. And so I have a cover that looks like my branding, like with my name and my series name. And I always have the title. I generally don&#8217;t put up a preorder without a title, but you could do that. So anyway, so that&#8217;s what I do. And then when I come, when they get the cover I put the cover up. And then when I have the sample ready, I put the sneak peek up. But I try to do it well in advance of the release date so that there&#8217;s time for it to kind of get into the system. After a while, after I&#8217;ve had the sneak peek up for a while exclusively on Amazon, I will make it available to my mailing list. And then I have it delivered by BookFunnel. But they can also download directly from Apple them as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>34:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said custom preview. What is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>34:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the custom preview. So by default, the web stores where you load your epub or wherever you&#8217;re loading, and they&#8217;ll take the first five or 10%. And a customer can go, oh, like you&#8217;re in a bookstore, I&#8217;m going to preview the book. And they&#8217;ll allow them to read the first five, take a look inside the book. It&#8217;s a look inside feature. And so with Apple, I love this about Apple, because again they let you pick exactly what you want to show. So never mind the, you know, the copyright stuff in the beginning in the introduction or any of that stuff. Let&#8217;s get right to the point. And you can put in a custom, this is what I want them to see Very clean, very, very controlled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another question. If you&#8217;re working&nbsp;through Draft2Digital, what is the difference working with these other book retailers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great question. So the difference, the difference between going direct to Apple and Draft2Digital, the only difference is technically the 10%. You make 10% less, because Draft2Digital keeps 10%. So instead of getting 70%, you&#8217;ll get 60. In terms of marketing, to be quite honest, I adore the people at Apple because they care, not about how you&#8217;re publishing, they care about what you&#8217;re publishing. And is it good? And is this good to feature for customers? They care about the reader experience, and so they&#8217;re just as willing to work with authors who are through an aggregator as they are to work direct. If anything, I would venture, and I&#8217;m not speaking for them, but I would venture to guess that it probably helps them that there are aggregators willing to do some curation and customer service and help so that they can continue to focus on their platform and creating a great reader experience. So you don&#8217;t have to be direct, you don&#8217;t have to be through Draft2Digital. Either should work for you well. I do know there are, we do have through Draft2Digital promotion opportunities for authors, if you go to d2d.tips/conference and sign up, so d2d.tips/conference, there&#8217;s a form where you can say, hey, I&#8217;m publishing military sci fi to Apple or some of the other platforms. And when we get opportunities that are unique to your genre with Apple, we may send an invite for you to submit. Now, for every 100 titles we get, they accept one or two. So it&#8217;s very hard to get in. But you keep trying. That&#8217;s the one thing, that you want to keep trying, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And I go, I go through Draft2Digital for Apple Books. Not really, for some other retailers I don&#8217;t. But I love going, it&#8217;s very easy. And I love that. Because one of the promos a few years ago, they started offering promos through there. And I thought that was really cool that they were reaching out and giving us those opportunities without you having, whether you&#8217;re direct with them or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love being wide. I&#8217;m emotionally committed to being wide, and all my books are wide. However, I am also desperate to pay the bills. And there are people richer and smarter than myself currently advising the strategy of going into another store for 90 days before going wide. And I&#8217;m tempted by that Apple. Ha. But I don&#8217;t want to anger the Apple gods. So I&#8217;m wondering how much that annoys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you mean, like, leaving Apple and going 90? I don&#8217;t know that Apple cares about that. I know that they care if you&#8217;re hopping back and forth. But I don&#8217;t know that they care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>38:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s one thing that I can tell you burns their butts. If you publish exclusively to some other platform, and publish your book in 2020. And then in 2021, you decide, I&#8217;m going to go and publish on Apple, on the other platforms. Please put the actual pub date, not the date you pubbed on Apple. They want an authentic user experience and they know that book is not … So I&#8217;ll give you an example. Star Wars came out in 1976? 1977. I was 8, I should be able to do the math. Just because it&#8217;s on Disney now doesn&#8217;t mean that the release date is 2019 when it got on to Disney. The release date is still 1977. Apple wants the same truth. If it was originally published on another platform, then please put that date in. Because sometimes I&#8217;ve had authors who just take, okay, all 20 of my books were published on April 1, 2020. And it&#8217;s like, well, that can&#8217;t be true. So they do, that annoys them more than publishing 90 days exclusive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t have an impact. Like, on the river store. Dropping it gives you that window. But that doesn&#8217;t happen on Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They care more about good books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So trying to trick them. There&#8217;s no …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no benefit to you doing that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s also annoying. It&#8217;s annoying to them because they don&#8217;t want … I mean, again. They&#8217;re partnering with you. They want to trust you. They want to believe you. And they want to represent to their customers that you&#8217;re a trustworthy, believable person. So if you had Star Wars come out in 1977. And you put that in your metadata, they&#8217;re going to believe that, and they&#8217;re going to tell their customers that, because that&#8217;s the truth of that situation. So you want to just be honest about it. And like he said, there&#8217;s no penalty to it. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s gonna hurt you in any way. So, you know, put down the right dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know what percentage you sell on the different stores?&nbsp;The major ones like Kobo Apple, Amazon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, Scribecount is a great tool for finding that out really fast. For me, Apple is my third highest store. For me it&#8217;s Amazon first, Kobo second, Apple third. I worked for Kobo, so I have a bit of insight there. What about you guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine sometimes fluctuates, but Apple is generally my second to Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me too. Apple&#8217;s my number two store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it tends to be number three. But there have been months where it&#8217;s been a strong number too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as a percentage, is it, I mean, does it ever get high, like 50% of your sales?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it&#8217;s close to like 10 to 15%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If something has been really pushed hard for me, or I&#8217;ve been chosen for some … like they used to do, I don&#8217;t know if they do this so much anymore. But like banners at the top, I&#8217;ve had some amazing months where I could actually like rival, you know, that other store. But I mean, so the potential is there. If you get noticed and get picked up for different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can I add, speaking of money, one of the things to think about with Apple is, there is no cap at 70% at $9.99. So box sets, and I know you guys have a lot of series books, you don&#8217;t have to limit yourself at $9.99. You could do a six-book box set and charge $16.99 because you&#8217;ll still make 70%, or 60 through D2D. And those did work well on Apple too, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the only thing you can&#8217;t do is, you can&#8217;t put that on Amazon for $9.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no. I wouldn&#8217;t even, I would publish it to Apple and Kobo and just leave it off Amazon, they can just buy them individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Readthrough wise, do you find that you have better readthrough on Apple? Or do you notice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t noticed much of a difference.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get better readthrough on Apple and Kobo. So for example, with Kobo, for every 500 free downloads, maybe I get 1 or 2%. I get like a small percentage of people. With Apple I can get the same readthrough with 50 free downloads. I found there&#8217;s a lot more Freegans on Kobo. With Apple, if they like it, they just click that button at the end of book one and book two. So I have noticed the readthrough&#8217;s better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I run a special, I don&#8217;t have a free first. Okay. So if I run a book at free on all platforms, I tend to get better sellthrough to book two on Apple, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Google Play than I get on Amazon. Amazon&#8217;s about 1 to 2%. On Apple, I can sometimes get 10 to 20%. But to me, that&#8217;s a special situation for a promotion, only because I don&#8217;t have a free first in series. Typically, what I would talk about is sellthrough from, they buy the first book, and then they buy the second book. I also have better sellthrough on those other platforms than he river store. If you&#8217;re in KU, what you have is readthrough. So you have people that are borrowing the books and reading through and that can be very powerful, because they&#8217;re not having to actually say, you know, at the point of purchase when they download the book. So in my case, read through KU can be a lot higher than sellthrough, even on the river store. There&#8217;s less resistance. It&#8217;s a completely frictionless experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you see your reviews on Apple? I&#8217;ve had readers tell me, and I can&#8217;t find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefevbre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you see your reviews on Apple, is the question. Ideally, you&#8217;re on an Apple device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t think you can on mine. I think you see stars, like if you go to whatever it is, like books.apple.com. I think you see the stars. I don&#8217;t think it exposes reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to use the device itself. So a tablet or an iPhone, so you have to have a friend who&#8217;s an Apple person. It could just be, so what you&#8217;re seeing there in that case is, it&#8217;s not a review, somebody ranked the book. Which is good, because that actually does help with social proof. I mean, it is nice to have a few words, but a ranking is beneficial because it adds to the star rating. And you&#8217;ll see that on other platforms. Apple, Kobo, as well. So, other hands, we still have a few minutes. The only other thing I was gonna bring up, if there&#8217;s no other questions, is I use third-party newsletters to get people to Apple. You can do ads, you can target Facebook ads or BookBub ads, and specifically target Apple readers if you&#8217;re looking to get more people onto the Apple platform. I really do like the … You can&#8217;t always get a BookBub. It&#8217;s like, yeah, I&#8217;m gonna win the lottery today. That&#8217;s what it feels like. So I can buy a ticket, but I might not win. But usually with a Bargain Booksy or a Fussy Librarian, eReader News Today, or some of the other platforms, usually you can pretty much almost guarantee to get that. So when I&#8217;m doing promos, even if I have a promo that&#8217;s on Kobo, for example, where I&#8217;m dropping the price everywhere, I&#8217;ll book a newsletter … and I even have found, and I&#8217;ve gotten some Kobo promos through Kobo Writing Life. And then while the promo&#8217;s about to be featured, I then run some newsletters or even my own newsletter as part of them. And I&#8217;ve actually outsold on Apple more than I sold on the Kobo. That week that Kobo is featuring my book, because I mean, Apple does have more customers globally, as Diane said. So those newsletters can also help get Apple readers, because they say hey, I read on Apple devices and I read romantic suspense. And therefore I&#8217;m going to, they&#8217;re going to find your books that way too. So any other tools that you guys have used, or strategies?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>46:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my predominant one right now, is just paid newsletters. I stopped running ads this year, just kind of as an experiment. So I only do paid newsletters, and I only do the ones that support wide books. And yeah, that works really well. And then newsletter swaps with other authors is a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>46:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any particular newsletters that you recommend? I&#8217;m always suspicious that they say they link to all the stores, but they&#8217;ve got like three people subscribed who read on Apple. Do you have any recommendations?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bargain Booksy, FreeBooksy, Robin Reads, Book Cave, Fussy Librarian.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a member of the Wide for the Win Facebook group, there&#8217;s a really great list. And they even tell you by genre, right? Because I mean, area foods, the head of that. I mean, she writes a certain genre. So obviously it&#8217;s gonna work for her but not for some of my stuff. But I always go back to that because it&#8217;s bookmarked at the top, so I go back go whenever I&#8217;m on a promo, and it&#8217;s like who should I try to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a little bit labor intensive. But luckily, most of them, you don&#8217;t pay until you submit everything. So I&#8217;ll open the form. And if the form is just like give us the ASIN and nothing else, it&#8217;s just like, close tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you find much success running 99 cent ads through bargain newsletters, or is it just free that really does well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve only done free first in series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>48:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve done okay with 99 cent ads. I like them a little bit better, because it&#8217;s obviously, I know the volume&#8217;s not as high. But at least I&#8217;m making 35 cents back right away. Not hoping for the return. And I think there was another hand up because we&#8217;re just 30 seconds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>48:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve gone wide with every retailer except for [inaudible]. And I don&#8217;t want to give out my Social Security or whatever. So do I need to go to Draft2Digital for that? And I realized it&#8217;s like, we can&#8217;t give you the answer. But is there anything that like, the difference between going direct and going… like, things that I can&#8217;t do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>48:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think there are things you can&#8217;t do going through Draft2Digital. I mean, the big thing is the 10%, right? You&#8217;re making less, honestly. And the Apple reps are great about treating you the same whether you&#8217;re direct or not. They&#8217;re really wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and even if you get like a promo through them, like if they reach out, they&#8217;ll say you know, okay, you&#8217;re through D2D. Confirm. And one of my friends had to send like a screenshot confirming a price change schedule. But that was it. It was just like, make sure you&#8217;re gonna make this when we advertise it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, they&#8217;ve contacted us to say, hey, do you know so and so? Could you reach out and see if they want to participate in a promo? So they&#8217;re really good about that. Because again, they want really good books.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a quick second question if we have time. Is it important to have translations since [inaudible] of the readership is throughout the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have any. It won&#8217;t hurt, for sure. I would love to have lots of translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It won&#8217;t hurt. But right now it&#8217;s, you know, seven to $10,000 to do it. I wouldn&#8217;t do it unless you&#8217;re taking it from a funding that you already have, that you&#8217;re not going in the hole in making translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>50:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build yourself up first would be what I would say, and then look into that when you&#8217;ve got the revenue and you feel like you can really get readers in some of those other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>50:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes a while to earn back those investments, and most of the authors I&#8217;ve talked to who are doing translations will say that if you ask them honestly. Some genres do better in some locations, like Greg and Mark and I were talking last night, I think that French is a big thing right now. But partly because you know, there&#8217;s Canada, where you know, French is a second language right? So I would, I agree with everybody else. I would only do those when you have money to invest and when you have a long time horizon covering the investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>50:59Well, thank you for your great questions.

So let&#8217;s jump right in to that special, and thanks to all the folks at 20 Books for allowing us to use this audio. Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll wait till we&#8217;re on time. Should we start early, you guys? Alright, let&#8217;s do it. Okay, welcome. Welcome to the Apple Books panel. I&#8217;m going to let these wonderful folks introduce themselves. My name is Mark Leslie Lefevbre, I am the Director of Business Development with Draft2Digital. And I am, of course, a huge fan of Apple and the Apple Books store. And I&#8217;m really here because I&#8217;m excited about opportunities for authors to earn money everywhere. And I know Apple has some great opportunities, which is why I invited these folks, because they&#8217;re really smart and knowledgeable and they know stuff. And I know you&#8217;re going to get some great benefits. So Cheryl, why don&#8217;t we start with you and your background, what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Cheryl Bradshaw, I write mainstream mystery thriller and suspense. I&#8217;ve been published for about 10 years, I have about 50 books. Um …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in terms of Apple, have you always been publishing to Apple, and how have you published to Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. So I started off … before Kindle Unlimited, there was KDP Select. And that was not a subscription service, like it is kind of now. And I was selling like mad in there. I just right out the gate was just selling like crazy. So I just stayed on there. And then when KU came, it kind of shifted for me in what I write, in that I found that KU wasn&#8217;t for everyone. I mean, a lot of my demographic, so I decided to go kind of play the field. And I went in, I went and signed up for all the platforms, and just spent the next quite a while like trying to build up readers from all platforms, and go wide. So that&#8217;s my process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m Diane Capri. I write mystery thriller and suspense. I&#8217;m trying to talk loud so I can reach all the way in the back back there. Can you hear me? Yay, okay. I am probably best known for my Hunt for Jack Reacher series, which is a spinoff of my friend Lee Child&#8217;s Jack Reacher novels. But I also write traditional mystery, and I have even one cozy series. And I have some other thrillers as well. I think I have 50-something books, I haven&#8217;t counted them lately. And my entire catalog, not the whole catalog, but most of it is wide. I started in 2011, when there was no KDP Select, and there was no KU. But I still started off with Amazon because I was learning and I had no idea what I was doing. So I decided I would choose one retailer and learn to do it. And then I could figure out what to do after that. So then, starting in about late 2012, I went wide, which at that time was Barnes &amp; Noble. And that might have been all actually, and then Apple came on board after that, and then Kobo after that, and then Google Play after that. So that&#8217;s where I am now, in addition to libraries. And Tulino, I get to through D2D. I&#8217;m in Baker and Taylor and Overdrive for libraries. I also publish in print, paperback, hardcover, large print and audio. So I think at this point, not speaking about my physique, but I believe my catalogue is as wide as you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>04:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is John Wilker. I write primarily space opera sci fi adventure. I have 13 books out and been doing this since 2017. So pretty new to it. I dabbled in KU for the first book for just the one-time three-month window that I was in. Didn&#8217;t really like it, didn&#8217;t do very well. And just then kind of realized that that&#8217;s not how, as like a business standpoint, I wanted to work. I wanted to be as wide as I possibly could be. The controlling piece of me made sure I went direct wherever I could. I even signed up for Google Play, I think like, while I was in KU, because they opened the window briefly where you didn&#8217;t have to be through like D2D or anyone else. So I just signed up, I was like, well, I don&#8217;t know if I really need this, but if they open the door, I&#8217;m gonna jump in real fast. But yeah, so I&#8217;ve been wide pretty much, with the exception of the first few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>05:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you guys. So just to give you guys a bit of a background, and I would like to say, as an author myself, I write urban fantasy, as well as horros. Just wanting to make sure we had a bit of a variety of content here as well, so we can talk about it. So let&#8217;s talk about Apple Books. Let&#8217;s talk about the Apple brand. Let&#8217;s talk about the Apple storefront. Can I just see a show of hands from how many of you actually read ebooks? Yay. No, it&#8217;s true. I just had to ask. How many read ebooks on an Apple device? Okay, great. So, so the folks who raised their hand—and just for the folks at home, we probably have, I think eight or nine people who read on an Apple device, which is pretty good. You probably are familiar with the storefront, the Apple storefront, as opposed to oftentimes we think only of the world&#8217;s longest river storefront as the only place to go. But so you know that there&#8217;s … so what about the Apple storefront, just from a customer&#8217;s perspective, what is it about the Apple storefront that makes it such a unique and we agree that it&#8217;s a very customer-centric experience. But what do you guys find it to be like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in like the page itself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, like how do they do things? And how is it different than that rive place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think well, the page itself, the way that they break things down into categories, super easy. It&#8217;s super easy. Paid top, paid top, free. I can go on and like that, I can know who my competition is, who&#8217;s doing well, what&#8217;s going on, I can find my books real simple and easy. And I also like the colors of it, like the bold color, like they take your book and they make it, I don&#8217;t know, they do something with the colors to make it really stand out over there. And I really like that, they just, I think it&#8217;s very easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>07:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I like is, it&#8217;s very minimalistic, and it&#8217;s very specific, like, you know, the river store. When you go to Apple Books, its books. They&#8217;re not trying to push even their own stuff. They&#8217;re not pushing iPods and you know, laptops on you. It&#8217;s, here&#8217;s books, and they have all kinds of curated categories. And very Apple-like, everything is very heavily curated. Which is kind of, which I like. Like, it&#8217;s not just which thing had the keywords that gamed the algorithm. Somebody looked at and said, I like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>07:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I like about the store is, it&#8217;s actually a store, and it&#8217;s just an Apple store. It comes preloaded on every Apple iPhone, and every iPad. So everybody who has one of those things has the store, which is great. I mean, there&#8217;s something like a billion units or some crazy thing out there, Apple likes to say. So anybody who has an iPhone, which is like a million people, can access the store, which is a great thing, they don&#8217;t have to download an app or anything else. Reading the books on an Apple device in the Apple Store is a very pleasant experience. It looks like an actual book. And when you can flip the pages and the pages kind of turn. And that&#8217;s kind of cool. And it&#8217;s all in color. And it feels more like reading a book. And it&#8217;s easy. The fonts are clean and clear. Apple&#8217;s very picky about, like Cheryl said, the colors, they have a whole color palette, they require a certain type, a certain size, when you upload your cover and all that. They actually physically look at every single book that gets uploaded in the store to make sure that it passes their quality controls. So every book you get looks great. Works great. You know, you can find it. I think it&#8217;s just a terrific app. I really do. And I like it a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. So I want to get into some of the, I know you guys are looking for, you know, what are the specific things you can do to try and increase your chances of discoverability? And when we were talking before this started, there was a really great analogy about the author who just puts their books up and then walks away and thinks, okay, I&#8217;m done. That&#8217;s all I need to do now. I&#8217;m gonna go run Amazon ads now. But so, what are some of the, we were talking a little bit about some of the analogy of, what are the things that are really, really important for the Apple experience? It&#8217;s not just, you put your book up there and yes, they have customers, it&#8217;s going to be featured. But how do you get visibility? There was a really great shopping analogy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you&#8217;re waiting for me to say this, but I like to fish where the fish are, right? So Apple is, I think of it kind of like a store in a mall. So you have your book, and it&#8217;s there. And there are people that are coming to the mall all the time, coming to the Apple bookstore all the time. But they aren&#8217;t necessarily looking at you. I mean, maybe they&#8217;re there to buy shoes, right? And not really, because the Apple bookstore is all books. But maybe they&#8217;re there to buy a book about shoes, okay? But if you want them to buy your book, you have to get their attention. There are things you have to do, you know, and if it were really a mall, maybe you&#8217;d hire a clown to, you know, stand outside and wave them in or whatever. But getting your books uploaded on the store is just like the first step. Then you have to find a way to get those readers who are there, they are coming to the mall, you have to find a way to get those readers who are there to notice you and to buy your book. And that&#8217;s on you. I mean, Apple&#8217;s going to help you because when you upload, you&#8217;re going to list your categories. And you&#8217;re going to have your great-looking book, and you&#8217;re going to pass the quality standards, and you&#8217;re going to be in the right spots. But it&#8217;s on you to bring people to your book and help them find you. And really it&#8217;s like that on all the storefronts. But we&#8217;re used to doing it, as Mark said, on the river store. And we know how. So on Apple we don&#8217;t necessarily know how, but it&#8217;s the same thing. We have to get them to come to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are some of the options or strategies that have worked to get people to go check out your books on Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They really like free first in series. My longer series has a permafree book one. And even when before I kind of learned how to reach out to them, they reached out to me and were like, hey, we&#8217;re doing a big thing. It&#8217;s gonna be on the homepage of the bookstore, free first in series science fiction. Cool to include you in it? Like, of course. And I had people that I know who would like send screenshots like, oh, I was looking for a new book to read, and there&#8217;s yours like on the front page of the carousel on the Apple Books page. So that&#8217;s definitely one, they really like free first in series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, and that was that was a case, just to confirm. Apple reached out to you asking to make a book free that wasn&#8217;t free?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it was free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, it was free already, they wanted to make sure you kept it free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Yeah, that was really the gist of the email. They&#8217;re like, you&#8217;re not changing the price anytime soon?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do want to talk a bit about that. Because when I worked for Kobo, I used to run their self-publishing platform there. That free first in series was a great funnel that I know a lot of people talk about. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily work all that well on Amazon, especially since you only get the five days of free exclusivity. But in all the other stores including Apple, you can make permafree. And the merchandisers love it, because they know that funnel works. If they feature your first book, you probably saw some sales on those two and three, right? They know, the long run is if they can hook the right readers, that&#8217;s going to be a profitable venture. So that is a strategy that works. The other thing I want to kind of allude to, as we&#8217;re talking about this, is preorders are really important on Apple. Can you guys talk a little bit about some of the features or some of the options that are available related to preorders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great thing I think about doing preorders on there is that there&#8217;s flexibility. You can put up for your cover, you can kind of do a placeholder and you can change the date, you can … you know, they&#8217;re really flexible in what they will allow you to do on there with your, with regard to like putting it up and adding stuff to it later or replacing the cover or whatever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you put up a preorder on Apple, you can put it up for a year. And you don&#8217;t really have to do anything else other than get it ready to release it on time. But people will find it and they&#8217;ll click it for preorder. And then you&#8217;ll have built-in sales when your book releases finally. There used to be kind of a little timeline, and I didn&#8217;t look it up to tell you what it is. But basically I do a one year preorder. And then as soon as I have the book to the point where I can, I put up a sneak peek. And I use usually 50 pages. By this time I have a cover. So I have the cover. I have the first 50 pages at the end, and you know, it&#8217;s not exactly 50 pages but about that many. And then at the end of the sample I put a link to preorder the book. And I call that, they call that a sneak peek on Apple. And they feature those and they use those sneak peeks to help them curate upcoming releases. They use the preorders in the same way. So if they&#8217;re looking to do say, some kind of promotion for cozy mysteries, and Diane has a sneak peek at a cozy mystery that&#8217;s coming up during the promotion period, they might then contact me and say, you know, are you going to definitely do this? And if you are, sort of like with his, you know, can we feature your book? I always say no. So I was gonna say, there&#8217;s a lot of things like that that you can do to sort of get their attention, but you have to be kind of in the pipeline, like Mark said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>15:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna add too, the other nice thing with preorders or just another thing they like to do is, because it&#8217;s on all the iPhones and iPads, they&#8217;ll just send out push notifications and be like, you know, you read this book, and you get those from, you know, an email from Amazon. But this comes up on someone&#8217;s screen, it wakes up the phone and says, John Wilker has a new book out, you read the last one and liked it, want to know more? Then they can tap right on that push notification and go right to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So another thing about the preorders is, Apple is a unique store in that a lot of them have a preview, whether it&#8217;s a preorder or not. And the preview is usually the first 5 or 10% of the book. With Apple, you can customize. If you&#8217;re publishing to Apple Books directly, you can go in and put whatever. So, like, obviously, hopefully the hook at the beginning of the book is good. But maybe you want to tease them, like they can&#8217;t wait to get to that point in the book where something happens. So if you&#8217;re publishing directly, you can put a custom preview, or if you&#8217;re publishing through an aggregator like Draft2Digital, there is a way for Draft2Digital to work with Apple to get that special custom preview for you. So that&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t think … how many of you guys knew about that option with Apple? A few people didn&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think too, and I don&#8217;t remember how the ranking works. But doesn&#8217;t Apple let you double dip on preorders with rank? I think you get rank as your preorder moves. And then on release day, you get again, celebrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, celebrating the realease basically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, which is great. I mean, only Kobo and Apple have that sort of two times bonus in different ways. But that is a really great feature and a question. If it&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;ll just wait to, probably in another eight or so minutes I&#8217;ll just open it up to questions if that&#8217;s okay. Okay. Thank you. We talked about the preview. So we didn&#8217;t talk about something that&#8217;s really important. We talked about the fact that Apple is very much curated, right. So some of the people that I know at Apple have worked in traditional publishing, and that it&#8217;s not just this hodgepodge of everything. It is, they do have a huge catalogue. They can feature audiobooks, and ebooks, too, right? So if you have both of them, they&#8217;re pretty good. The metadata is clear and clean. They&#8217;re pretty good at linking those together. So you can have them. But we talked about Apple as partners. Could you guys expand upon that? The thought of Apple as not just being this platform, but actually being in partnership with the authors that they publish?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>18:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think when we were talking earlier about the build, like, you got to start somewhere on there to build up your platform. And they&#8217;re watching for like, hey, I keep seeing her, this person&#8217;s book or whatever. They&#8217;re watching. Because like, when he was talking about the promos, they&#8217;ll do, they do promos all the time. And there&#8217;s like, maybe like one that revolves around Christmas, or one that revolves around winter, and then they&#8217;re looking to see like, which authors can we include in this? And so if you&#8217;ve, if you&#8217;re doing what you can to like, push things up, like I would say, if you&#8217;re first starting out, and you are … free is good in the beginning, because that is how a reader will pick you up and read you. Because, you know, they&#8217;re not paying anything on somebody that they don&#8217;t know, well, am I gonna like this if I spend six bucks on it or whatever? You know, so you&#8217;ve got to get the reader first and then keep the reader. And so as you start building your platform on there, and your books start getting more visibility, that&#8217;s when you have these opportunities where they work with you more on a personal level. Because they&#8217;re, it&#8217;s like being rewarded for doing hard work on their platform and building and building and growing yourself, and then in turn, that&#8217;s when they&#8217;ll kind of pick and choose, like reach out and say, you know, hey, I noticed you&#8217;ve been doing really good on that, can we include your book?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>19:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want you to demonstrate that you understand, that you&#8217;re a partner with them. You know, you&#8217;re not there expecting them to do something for you. You&#8217;re there expecting that you&#8217;re going to work together with them. So for example, if you&#8217;re running Facebook ads, make sure you have an Apple link in that ad. If you&#8217;ve got your books on your web page and your listing where the books can be bought, make sure you have Apple on there. They look. They do check. They want to know, is this person serious about being an Apple author or not? And some people are not, some people want to just come in and give it a try. And they don&#8217;t want to, you know, be partners with Apple. And those are ones honestly, that generally are not happy and feel like they haven&#8217;t done well. But if you&#8217;re partnering with Apple, it&#8217;s to your advantage to do all these things. And they like it when you do all these things, because then they feel like you&#8217;re working with them. And they want to work with you. And like everybody here, you know, I&#8217;ve talked to these people. And I can say for sure that that is what they are looking for. And that&#8217;s what they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>20:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to that end, they will accept inclusive links. So you have links to Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble and Apple and Kobo and Google and whatever. When you use the logo, if you haven&#8217;t already, update your logo to the Apple Books logo. If it says iBooks, that&#8217;s going to be a little bit of an annoyance that they&#8217;re not going to like that, because they did change their branding a couple years ago. And so be very careful about that. So make sure that it is a logo. You can also use a Books2Read or some sort of universal link, because all they really want is inclusivity. Not exclusivity. They just want to make sure they&#8217;re included, as well. So that&#8217;s the other thing, but it&#8217;s a subtle thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t seen that to be true. I had a bunch of links, and I was using D2D. I had all of the links. And Apple rejected my book because Amazon&#8217;s links were included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You had all the links … si the question was, for the people at home, you had all the links on your website? Oh, in the book, okay, so no, in the book itself. Think about this. I go to Diane Capri&#8217;s party because she invited me, and I start inviting people to go to Jasmine Walt&#8217;s party in the other room. Oh, no, on your website. Yeah, no, no. So a Books2Read link in your book is fine. But if you have links to all the other stores in that book, trying to draw people to a different store from Apple. Oh, yeah. They will reject your book. Thank you for asking that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all the stores will do that. None of the stores will accept that. And it makes perfect sense. I wouldn&#8217;t want that if I owned a store. And you probably wouldn&#8217;t either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, sorry, I misunderstood what you meant by inclusive links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, no, inclusive links on the website. They just want to make sure that they&#8217;re included, as well. So that&#8217;s the other thing as well, I&#8217;m going to do just a little bit of advertisement for Books2Read, we tried to roll this into production yesterday, and had to roll it back, there was like a 10 minute maintenance window where you couldn&#8217;t go and edit your Books2Read. And the idea is that you&#8217;ll be able to change the store priority. So if you wanted to put Apple first because you love Apple, you could do that. Or if you wanted to put your PayHip or whatever. But the whole idea is that if you want to impress Apple, take all your Books2Read links, and put the Apple links first. So that is coming soon. And obviously you can control that on your own website at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are lots of readers in Apple, at least a billion people have access to the store. That&#8217;s a pretty large number of customers out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s more than people in my hometown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine too, actually. More than the dollars in my bank account. So we&#8217;ve talked about how we can partner with Apple. So then did you want to talk about how we can help ourselves there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and that&#8217;s the next thing is, so how can we, how can we take ownership and control? Especially because I&#8217;ll be honest with you. I mean, they contacted John, they haven&#8217;t yet contacted me. I don&#8217;t sell enough. I don&#8217;t have enough play on Apple yet. It is growing slowly. But so, how can someone like me? How can I help myself on Apple?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way that I think is one of the best ways when you&#8217;re just starting out is to find your author people. Like, when she says fish where the fish are with your readers, I think you can fish where the fish are with your authors. You&#8217;re trying to go wide. Go look in your genre. Who do you know that is also on Apple? And you get a bunch of you, get all your posse together. And then you do like some kind of a group giveaway that it is exclusively trying to get readers specifically for Apple. You want to talk a little bit about our [inaudible] that we did?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, sure. So several years ago, we did that, exactly what Cheryl&#8217;s doing. We did it together. John wasn&#8217;t with us then, but next time. And so we had, at that time I think we took 25 authors, and we ran a big giveaway. I think I used King Sumo for it. And everybody in the group, you know, rang the bell and tried to get readers to come on board. And the prize was a paid book, not a free book, a paid book from each of the 25 authors. So each of the authors donated, I think, five books. And so we had five winners who won 25 books each. So it was a big giveaway. And the way we funded it was with the free Apple Book codes that we get.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you get free Apple Book codes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know Mark. With every book you upload to Apple, they will give you 250 codes for free books. Now, the codes do expire. So you don&#8217;t want to just go in and get 250 the day you upload your book, and then think you&#8217;ll give them out, you know, over the next 100 years, or whatever it is. I think it&#8217;s 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s 30 days before they expire. So you want batches, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you want to wait till you&#8217;re ready to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And know how you&#8217;re going to use them, because you just have a limited window. So trying to get your thoughts together on like, what can I do with these to maximize them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can request those if you&#8217;re direct with Apple, right? By emailing the support. You can request them through a distributor like Draft2Digital, and they&#8217;ll request them for you. So you can do it either way. Quick, quick question on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are those codes for you to give to your customer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and you can give them away in a zillion ways. And they will help you get your reviews on Apple, like you can give them to your arc team and ask them to post reviews for you. You can give them out as a giveaway, you know, indicate that, you know, if anybody would like a free book, if you&#8217;d like to review it, you know, you can get your reviews that way. The nice thing is, it applies to any book that you have. So it doesn&#8217;t have to be just your first, or just your free book, or anything like that. So yes, 250 codes, each and every book, any time you want. But they do expire. So that&#8217;s the only thing to keep in mind. Yeah. And it works really well for group promos and giveaways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, it was amazing for us. Like, we were all trying to just grow our readership on there. And it made a huge difference, pooling us all together for one goal, for the one goal in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it really cost us nothing except a little bit of effort. Because the codes were free. And we just, you know, we put it on our websites, we put it on our social media pages, you know, on our newsletters, and that&#8217;s how we got people to do it. And we got a lot of a lot of readers, got a lot of traction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know that people are signing up for that for the right reasons. Because what they&#8217;re getting, they&#8217;re books. And so you don&#8217;t have people that are signing up for your giveaway or whatever that are interested in like a gift card or whatever. These are actual readers, you know they are, because they know that what they&#8217;re going to receive are books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know they&#8217;re Apple Books readers, because what they&#8217;re getting is a code for an Apple Book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you get those when you upload the book? Or do you, anytime you can request them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get them any time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then how many times per book can you request them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>250.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it? So you use 250 and then now you move on to the next book, kind of a thing. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I personally, I would not do that. I don&#8217;t do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you do batches of 10?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well it depends. So in this instance, we had 25 winners. So I requested 25 codes. So you don&#8217;t have to request all 250 at the same time. You could take two. You could take one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>28:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could request 250 individual times for one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the best part is, tou can do your promo ahead of it. So it&#8217;s not like you get the codes and then you got a ticking clock. You can do your promo and then request it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so you got 30 days after they give them to you. Yeah, so that&#8217;s an important …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Apple more friendly about giving away free books and getting reviews?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving away free books and getting reviews …. You can make the book free if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you mean in the terms of service, like …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you can&#8217;t give away a book and say you&#8217;ve got to give me a review if I give you this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I don&#8217;t think you can do that anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s more of a legality, sort of moralistic thing. However, Apple will not penalize people for having to have a verified purchase. They haven&#8217;t gone in and purged reviews. So when you get an Apple review, you actually get to keep the Apple review. It doesn&#8217;t disappear on you. But that&#8217;s an important thing, because you can work really hard on another retailer, and then the reviews disappear for no rhyme or reason. But if you actually work hard to get Apple readers to review your books, they&#8217;re gonna stay there. I mean, unless there&#8217;s something rebelious or whatever in the in the review, and they go, well, you can&#8217;t say this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, you can&#8217;t … I mean, any child that I know would not be happy if you said to them, you know, here&#8217;s this cookie, but you know, you have to do this first. I mean, it&#8217;s not a quid pro quo. You can&#8217;t do that. But you can give out, you know, you can put every book in your catalog on Apple for free forever if you want to. I don&#8217;t know why you want to do that. But you could. They don&#8217;t …&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can have a free book on Apple that costs everywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, no. So one thing, thank you for that question. One thing about the retailers that a lot of people don&#8217;t realize is, the contract you have with Apple, with Kobo, with Nook, with Google, with Amazon, is you cannot have a lower price on any other retail site. Amazon&#8217;s the only one will come in and kneecap you if your price is lower. I mean, they&#8217;ll usually aggressively auto price match. But all other retailers have that. So if your book is free somewhere, it should be free everywhere. Now, it obviously can&#8217;t be on Amazon if you&#8217;re wide. So then you rely on their aggressive price-matching. But that is one thing to do. So if you&#8217;re dropping the price to zero, you should you&#8217;re bound by the contracts that you should drop them free, or everyone has the right to price match at your expense. So next question right there? No, sorry, one at a time. Questions expire after 30 days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[inaudible] codes US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re geocoded. So you can only give out US codes to US customers. But you get them from all the stores. I don&#8217;t know if you get 250 from every store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you have to request the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You request the geo …? Yeah, that&#8217;s a good, that&#8217;s a good point. But the question is, can you get 250 for US only? Yeah. Great question. Why don&#8217;t we let him ask number two?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s just say, hypothetically, that we&#8217;re distributing on Draft2Digital [inaudible]. How do we go about [inaudible]?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Yeah, if you&#8217;re publishing to Apple through Draft2Digital, you can contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:support@draft2digital.com\">support@draft2digital.com</a>&nbsp;and request the custom preview. You can also request the codes as well. So that&#8217;s as easy as that. There&#8217;s actual real humans, one of which is that the Draft2Digital table this week. Another question right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you were talking about the preorders, Diane, and then you said later you would put your cover up, what are you putting up if you don&#8217;t have the cover for that long preorder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I have the cover, I put it up. Sometimes I have it. Sometimes I don&#8217;t. If I don&#8217;t have it, I put up a placeholder cover, which early on when I used to do this, it was actually pretty ugly. It was just nothing but the right shape, you know. But now what I have is, I have all my branding, but no art. And so I have a cover that looks like my branding, like with my name and my series name. And I always have the title. I generally don&#8217;t put up a preorder without a title, but you could do that. So anyway, so that&#8217;s what I do. And then when I come, when they get the cover I put the cover up. And then when I have the sample ready, I put the sneak peek up. But I try to do it well in advance of the release date so that there&#8217;s time for it to kind of get into the system. After a while, after I&#8217;ve had the sneak peek up for a while exclusively on Amazon, I will make it available to my mailing list. And then I have it delivered by BookFunnel. But they can also download directly from Apple them as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>34:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said custom preview. What is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>34:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the custom preview. So by default, the web stores where you load your epub or wherever you&#8217;re loading, and they&#8217;ll take the first five or 10%. And a customer can go, oh, like you&#8217;re in a bookstore, I&#8217;m going to preview the book. And they&#8217;ll allow them to read the first five, take a look inside the book. It&#8217;s a look inside feature. And so with Apple, I love this about Apple, because again they let you pick exactly what you want to show. So never mind the, you know, the copyright stuff in the beginning in the introduction or any of that stuff. Let&#8217;s get right to the point. And you can put in a custom, this is what I want them to see Very clean, very, very controlled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another question. If you&#8217;re working&nbsp;through Draft2Digital, what is the difference working with these other book retailers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great question. So the difference, the difference between going direct to Apple and Draft2Digital, the only difference is technically the 10%. You make 10% less, because Draft2Digital keeps 10%. So instead of getting 70%, you&#8217;ll get 60. In terms of marketing, to be quite honest, I adore the people at Apple because they care, not about how you&#8217;re publishing, they care about what you&#8217;re publishing. And is it good? And is this good to feature for customers? They care about the reader experience, and so they&#8217;re just as willing to work with authors who are through an aggregator as they are to work direct. If anything, I would venture, and I&#8217;m not speaking for them, but I would venture to guess that it probably helps them that there are aggregators willing to do some curation and customer service and help so that they can continue to focus on their platform and creating a great reader experience. So you don&#8217;t have to be direct, you don&#8217;t have to be through Draft2Digital. Either should work for you well. I do know there are, we do have through Draft2Digital promotion opportunities for authors, if you go to d2d.tips/conference and sign up, so d2d.tips/conference, there&#8217;s a form where you can say, hey, I&#8217;m publishing military sci fi to Apple or some of the other platforms. And when we get opportunities that are unique to your genre with Apple, we may send an invite for you to submit. Now, for every 100 titles we get, they accept one or two. So it&#8217;s very hard to get in. But you keep trying. That&#8217;s the one thing, that you want to keep trying, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And I go, I go through Draft2Digital for Apple Books. Not really, for some other retailers I don&#8217;t. But I love going, it&#8217;s very easy. And I love that. Because one of the promos a few years ago, they started offering promos through there. And I thought that was really cool that they were reaching out and giving us those opportunities without you having, whether you&#8217;re direct with them or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love being wide. I&#8217;m emotionally committed to being wide, and all my books are wide. However, I am also desperate to pay the bills. And there are people richer and smarter than myself currently advising the strategy of going into another store for 90 days before going wide. And I&#8217;m tempted by that Apple. Ha. But I don&#8217;t want to anger the Apple gods. So I&#8217;m wondering how much that annoys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you mean, like, leaving Apple and going 90? I don&#8217;t know that Apple cares about that. I know that they care if you&#8217;re hopping back and forth. But I don&#8217;t know that they care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>38:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s one thing that I can tell you burns their butts. If you publish exclusively to some other platform, and publish your book in 2020. And then in 2021, you decide, I&#8217;m going to go and publish on Apple, on the other platforms. Please put the actual pub date, not the date you pubbed on Apple. They want an authentic user experience and they know that book is not … So I&#8217;ll give you an example. Star Wars came out in 1976? 1977. I was 8, I should be able to do the math. Just because it&#8217;s on Disney now doesn&#8217;t mean that the release date is 2019 when it got on to Disney. The release date is still 1977. Apple wants the same truth. If it was originally published on another platform, then please put that date in. Because sometimes I&#8217;ve had authors who just take, okay, all 20 of my books were published on April 1, 2020. And it&#8217;s like, well, that can&#8217;t be true. So they do, that annoys them more than publishing 90 days exclusive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t have an impact. Like, on the river store. Dropping it gives you that window. But that doesn&#8217;t happen on Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They care more about good books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So trying to trick them. There&#8217;s no …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no benefit to you doing that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s also annoying. It&#8217;s annoying to them because they don&#8217;t want … I mean, again. They&#8217;re partnering with you. They want to trust you. They want to believe you. And they want to represent to their customers that you&#8217;re a trustworthy, believable person. So if you had Star Wars come out in 1977. And you put that in your metadata, they&#8217;re going to believe that, and they&#8217;re going to tell their customers that, because that&#8217;s the truth of that situation. So you want to just be honest about it. And like he said, there&#8217;s no penalty to it. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s gonna hurt you in any way. So, you know, put down the right dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know what percentage you sell on the different stores?&nbsp;The major ones like Kobo Apple, Amazon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, Scribecount is a great tool for finding that out really fast. For me, Apple is my third highest store. For me it&#8217;s Amazon first, Kobo second, Apple third. I worked for Kobo, so I have a bit of insight there. What about you guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine sometimes fluctuates, but Apple is generally my second to Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me too. Apple&#8217;s my number two store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it tends to be number three. But there have been months where it&#8217;s been a strong number too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as a percentage, is it, I mean, does it ever get high, like 50% of your sales?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it&#8217;s close to like 10 to 15%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If something has been really pushed hard for me, or I&#8217;ve been chosen for some … like they used to do, I don&#8217;t know if they do this so much anymore. But like banners at the top, I&#8217;ve had some amazing months where I could actually like rival, you know, that other store. But I mean, so the potential is there. If you get noticed and get picked up for different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can I add, speaking of money, one of the things to think about with Apple is, there is no cap at 70% at $9.99. So box sets, and I know you guys have a lot of series books, you don&#8217;t have to limit yourself at $9.99. You could do a six-book box set and charge $16.99 because you&#8217;ll still make 70%, or 60 through D2D. And those did work well on Apple too, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the only thing you can&#8217;t do is, you can&#8217;t put that on Amazon for $9.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no. I wouldn&#8217;t even, I would publish it to Apple and Kobo and just leave it off Amazon, they can just buy them individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Readthrough wise, do you find that you have better readthrough on Apple? Or do you notice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t noticed much of a difference.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get better readthrough on Apple and Kobo. So for example, with Kobo, for every 500 free downloads, maybe I get 1 or 2%. I get like a small percentage of people. With Apple I can get the same readthrough with 50 free downloads. I found there&#8217;s a lot more Freegans on Kobo. With Apple, if they like it, they just click that button at the end of book one and book two. So I have noticed the readthrough&#8217;s better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I run a special, I don&#8217;t have a free first. Okay. So if I run a book at free on all platforms, I tend to get better sellthrough to book two on Apple, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Google Play than I get on Amazon. Amazon&#8217;s about 1 to 2%. On Apple, I can sometimes get 10 to 20%. But to me, that&#8217;s a special situation for a promotion, only because I don&#8217;t have a free first in series. Typically, what I would talk about is sellthrough from, they buy the first book, and then they buy the second book. I also have better sellthrough on those other platforms than he river store. If you&#8217;re in KU, what you have is readthrough. So you have people that are borrowing the books and reading through and that can be very powerful, because they&#8217;re not having to actually say, you know, at the point of purchase when they download the book. So in my case, read through KU can be a lot higher than sellthrough, even on the river store. There&#8217;s less resistance. It&#8217;s a completely frictionless experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you see your reviews on Apple? I&#8217;ve had readers tell me, and I can&#8217;t find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefevbre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you see your reviews on Apple, is the question. Ideally, you&#8217;re on an Apple device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t think you can on mine. I think you see stars, like if you go to whatever it is, like books.apple.com. I think you see the stars. I don&#8217;t think it exposes reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to use the device itself. So a tablet or an iPhone, so you have to have a friend who&#8217;s an Apple person. It could just be, so what you&#8217;re seeing there in that case is, it&#8217;s not a review, somebody ranked the book. Which is good, because that actually does help with social proof. I mean, it is nice to have a few words, but a ranking is beneficial because it adds to the star rating. And you&#8217;ll see that on other platforms. Apple, Kobo, as well. So, other hands, we still have a few minutes. The only other thing I was gonna bring up, if there&#8217;s no other questions, is I use third-party newsletters to get people to Apple. You can do ads, you can target Facebook ads or BookBub ads, and specifically target Apple readers if you&#8217;re looking to get more people onto the Apple platform. I really do like the … You can&#8217;t always get a BookBub. It&#8217;s like, yeah, I&#8217;m gonna win the lottery today. That&#8217;s what it feels like. So I can buy a ticket, but I might not win. But usually with a Bargain Booksy or a Fussy Librarian, eReader News Today, or some of the other platforms, usually you can pretty much almost guarantee to get that. So when I&#8217;m doing promos, even if I have a promo that&#8217;s on Kobo, for example, where I&#8217;m dropping the price everywhere, I&#8217;ll book a newsletter … and I even have found, and I&#8217;ve gotten some Kobo promos through Kobo Writing Life. And then while the promo&#8217;s about to be featured, I then run some newsletters or even my own newsletter as part of them. And I&#8217;ve actually outsold on Apple more than I sold on the Kobo. That week that Kobo is featuring my book, because I mean, Apple does have more customers globally, as Diane said. So those newsletters can also help get Apple readers, because they say hey, I read on Apple devices and I read romantic suspense. And therefore I&#8217;m going to, they&#8217;re going to find your books that way too. So any other tools that you guys have used, or strategies?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>46:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my predominant one right now, is just paid newsletters. I stopped running ads this year, just kind of as an experiment. So I only do paid newsletters, and I only do the ones that support wide books. And yeah, that works really well. And then newsletter swaps with other authors is a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>46:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any particular newsletters that you recommend? I&#8217;m always suspicious that they say they link to all the stores, but they&#8217;ve got like three people subscribed who read on Apple. Do you have any recommendations?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bargain Booksy, FreeBooksy, Robin Reads, Book Cave, Fussy Librarian.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a member of the Wide for the Win Facebook group, there&#8217;s a really great list. And they even tell you by genre, right? Because I mean, area foods, the head of that. I mean, she writes a certain genre. So obviously it&#8217;s gonna work for her but not for some of my stuff. But I always go back to that because it&#8217;s bookmarked at the top, so I go back go whenever I&#8217;m on a promo, and it&#8217;s like who should I try to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a little bit labor intensive. But luckily, most of them, you don&#8217;t pay until you submit everything. So I&#8217;ll open the form. And if the form is just like give us the ASIN and nothing else, it&#8217;s just like, close tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you find much success running 99 cent ads through bargain newsletters, or is it just free that really does well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve only done free first in series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>48:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve done okay with 99 cent ads. I like them a little bit better, because it&#8217;s obviously, I know the volume&#8217;s not as high. But at least I&#8217;m making 35 cents back right away. Not hoping for the return. And I think there was another hand up because we&#8217;re just 30 seconds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>48:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve gone wide with every retailer except for [inaudible]. And I don&#8217;t want to give out my Social Security or whatever. So do I need to go to Draft2Digital for that? And I realized it&#8217;s like, we can&#8217;t give you the answer. But is there anything that like, the difference between going direct and going… like, things that I can&#8217;t do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>48:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think there are things you can&#8217;t do going through Draft2Digital. I mean, the big thing is the 10%, right? You&#8217;re making less, honestly. And the Apple reps are great about treating you the same whether you&#8217;re direct or not. They&#8217;re really wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and even if you get like a promo through them, like if they reach out, they&#8217;ll say you know, okay, you&#8217;re through D2D. Confirm. And one of my friends had to send like a screenshot confirming a price change schedule. But that was it. It was just like, make sure you&#8217;re gonna make this when we advertise it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, they&#8217;ve contacted us to say, hey, do you know so and so? Could you reach out and see if they want to participate in a promo? So they&#8217;re really good about that. Because again, they want really good books.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Member&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a quick second question if we have time. Is it important to have translations since [inaudible] of the readership is throughout the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Wilker&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have any. It won&#8217;t hurt, for sure. I would love to have lots of translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>49:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It won&#8217;t hurt. But right now it&#8217;s, you know, seven to $10,000 to do it. I wouldn&#8217;t do it unless you&#8217;re taking it from a funding that you already have, that you&#8217;re not going in the hole in making translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheryl Bradshaw&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>50:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Build yourself up first would be what I would say, and then look into that when you&#8217;ve got the revenue and you feel like you can really get readers in some of those other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Capri&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>50:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes a while to earn back those investments, and most of the authors I&#8217;ve talked to who are doing translations will say that if you ask them honestly. Some genres do better in some locations, like Greg and Mark and I were talking last night, I think that French is a big thing right now. But partly because you know, there&#8217;s Canada, where you know, French is a second language right? So I would, I agree with everybody else. I would only do those when you have money to invest and when you have a long time horizon covering the investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>50:59Well, thank you for your great questions.

We make clear resolutions, often including writing goals like “<em>Finish that book!</em>”, and are steadfast about keeping them … for the first few weeks. After that, life tends to get in the way. We’re too busy to hit our target word count for one morning, then two. Before we know it, we’ve slipped right back into our old habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These five writing tools won’t achieve your writing goals for you, but they’ll give you the best chance of achieving them. From low (or no)-tech to cutting-edge, here are five tools that will help improve your focus and make it easier to hit your writing goals this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#1: Noice-canceling headphones</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re <a href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/writing-from-the-road-ep056/\">writing from the road</a> or simply trying to find a bit of quiet in a busy household, noise-canceling headphones can be an invaluable focus tool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like magic, they block out any outside noise that might distract you while you’re trying to write, from screaming children to road or airplane noise. Instead, you can listen to whatever helps you focus, from music to piped-in cafe noise. You can even use them to create a cone of silence, if that’s how you work best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bose is generally agreed to have the gold-standard offering, but far less expensive options serve the same ultimate purpose. For guidance, explore a few online reviews like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/\">this one from Wirecutter</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while you’re at it, check out targeted mood playlists (<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/genre/mood-page\">like Spotify’s</a>) to give you some aural inspiration while you write.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#2: The classic notebook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The notebook is about as low-tech as it gets. There are some fantastic options on the market, and we’ve listed our favorites below. But you don’t need anything fancy—and that’s why we love this tool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re the type of person who likes to write by hand, you probably already carry a notebook with you everywhere. You never know when inspiration will strike, and the best way to capture those moments is to <em>write them down</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notebooks come with considerable perks. They require no battery power, they aren’t generally a target for theft, and you can use them just about anywhere. Lower-end options can be purchased at the dollar store, or you can invest in higher-quality favorites like <a href=\"https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/\">Moleskine</a> or <a href=\"https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/\">Leuchtturm</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who like the look and feel of writing on paper but prefer the versatility of tech, check out a thin paper-like tablet like the <a href=\"https://remarkable.com/\">reMarkable tablet</a>, which can convert handwriting to typed text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#3: Word count apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re the goal-oriented or competitive type, tracking your daily writing habit will probably prove a powerful motivator. Once you string together a series of days in which you’ve hit a word count goal, momentum tends to build. After all, if you’ve committed to writing 500 words a day and you’ve shown up for the last 30 days, you’re far less likely to break your streak on day 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few tools we’ve found helpful in sticking to daily word count goals:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Scrivener: </strong>Scrivener is one of the fancier <a href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/whats-the-best-word-processor-for-writers/\">word processors for writers</a>, and one of its many features is a word count tracker that allows you to see how your actual word counts stack up against your targets.</li><li><strong>Gamified apps: </strong>Apps like <a href=\"https://4thewords.com/web/lobby\">4thewords</a> turn the act of <a href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/consistency-is-a-super-power/\">showing up to write every day</a> into a game, complete with a narrative arc—and you know we love those.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Habit trackers: </strong>There are countless habit tracking apps for both iPhone and Android that allow you to self-select goals, like daily word counts or writing times, and then check off each day you complete them. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477\">Productive</a> is one of the most popular (they have an <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apalon.to.do.list\">Android version</a> too) but search for habit trackers and you’ll find dozens. Play with a few to see what you like best.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#4: Dictation tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing every day is easy when you can write from literally anywhere. Notebooks, tablets, and laptops are great in most cases—but what about those moments when you’re taking a walk or stuck in traffic, with time to write but without the means? That’s where dictation can help you stay productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some indie author favorites for dictating on the go:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/pages/use-dictation-to-enter-text-tan59042a403/mac#:~:text=Place%20the%20insertion%20point%20where,the%20top%20of%20your%20screen).\"><strong>Apple Dictation</strong></a> is free and comes standard on Apple products, so this is a great entry point for iPhone users. You’ve got your phone with you anyway, so you may as well use it. Siri can even help the native dictation tool improve over time by learning your voice and speech patterns. One caveat, though: Apple Dictation isn’t great for long-form writing. Use it for quick notes or snippets of text, but look to other tools for long periods of recording.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Google Docs</strong> also has a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en\">free dictation tool</a>, available only in the Chrome browser. You can record for extended periods and even edit as you write. If you’re looking for the best device-agnostic free dictation tool, Google’s option is a strong contender. However, you need an active internet connection to use it, so it won’t work in remote areas with no WiFi or cell signal.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dragon</strong> is a <a href=\"https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html\">paid Microsoft-based software</a> that uses AI to produce highly accurate dictation. It requires some time and investment to download—but once you’ve got it, it’s one of the most popular tools around. Dragon offers advanced AI, high accuracy (99%), and versatility across a range of Microsoft software platforms like Word or email processors.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://otter.ai/\"><strong>Otter</strong></a> is another AI tool, but with a free option that makes it a bit more accessible than some of its pricier competitors. Otter offers limited transcription time at no cost, so you can try before you buy. It works mainly on recordings, so you won’t get a live voice-to-text transcription, but it doesn’t take long to generate a written record. You’ll need to download the text to another application, so it isn’t as seamless as other workflows—but nonfiction authors will love it for transcribing interviews and other audio-centric research.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#5: The Cloud</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d be remiss if we didn’t call out the cloud for the great work it’s doing. The cloud makes it possible to sync progress across all your devices. You can start a writing project on your laptop, pick up where you left off from your phone, and finish the whole thing on your tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syncing your work to the cloud (instead of saving to a specific machine or paper file) enables you to pick up a project anywhere. Even if you were last writing on your laptop at home and now find yourself with a few spare minutes in line at the post office, phone in hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud-based apps like <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/notes\">Apple Notes</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/docs/about/\">Google Docs</a> enable real-time syncing between devices. If you use a digital paper tablet like reMarkable, you can even access those notes from any device synced to that account. For writers, this means that scrambling around looking for work in one of a dozen different files is a thing of the past. With an easy-to-access searchable database in the cloud, your work is always ready when you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now—throw on those noise-canceling headphones, get an author playlist going, and write away!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/5-tools-to-help-you-reach-your-writing-goals/\">5 Tools to Help You Reach Your Writing Goals</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog\">Draft2Digital | Blog</a>.</p>","summary":"<p>For many of us, annual goals follow a predictable pattern.

This is Mark Leslie Lefevbre. I am the Director of Business Development with Draft2Digital and I&#8217;m honored to have in the virtual studio with me Robyn Peterman of the Magic and Mayhem Universe. Robyn, welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. It&#8217;s nice to be here, Mark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is awesome to get to chat with you. Now I want to get into the Magic and Mayhem Universe and all of the amazing things you&#8217;re doing. But I first want to get into—so Robyn Peterman, as a writer, when did this all start for you? How did you get into writing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a lie. Most of my grownup life, I was an actress, I was a professional actress. I&#8217;ve done Broadway, television, film. And after I had my kids, it didn&#8217;t make as much sense to me anymore. So I had to kind of refigure out what I wanted to do. And I&#8217;d always written. I used to do, I used to punch up jokes when I was an actor, which means … punch up scripts, which means write jokes. And I did some for television, for film, for … and so, but I&#8217;d never finished a book ever. And I decided in my late 40s that I was going to try. I was going to write a book. I told my husband I was gonna write a book. He was like, go on with your bad self. And I did. And I sent it out everywhere and nobody wanted it. Nobody wanted it. So I joined a writers&#8217; group and went to a con, a romance convention. It was RT, which doesn&#8217;t exist anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romantic Times, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I loved that one. Anyway, I was there. I was unpublished with a couple girlfriends from Kentucky in my writing group. And there was a thing called Pitchapalooza. And it&#8217;s agents and publishers. And it&#8217;s a big room and you&#8217;ve got like, three minutes to sit down and then the bell rings, then you go to another table and you pitch. And they were looking for contemporary romance, which is not what I wrote at all. But I thought, what do I have to lose? So I made up a book.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait, on the spot you made it up?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, no, I made it up right before it all happened. So I had something in my head. And I lied, basically, and everybody was laughing and like, I would say 12 or 14 different people asked for the full manuscript. So I lied some more, and I was like, freaking out on the inside. I&#8217;m like, well, okay, I said, I have to go home and get it professionally edited—which meant write it—and then I&#8217;ll send it to you in three weeks. So I went home, and I wrote a 95k book in three weeks. I got the shingles after that, which … I don&#8217;t recommend my method. If unfortunately I had to do it again. But, and then I got offers from several different places. And I went with a three-book deal with Kensington. So I started out traditional. So my entry into publishing was based on a lie, a big, fat, hairy lie. But as an actress, I was good, you know, I was good at talking to people, pitching. I was like, wow, you know! Yes, so that is literally how I started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that. So I&#8217;ve got to ask for the parallel between going to an audition or pitching the book. Was it a very similar experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, sure. I mean, I don&#8217;t really … Look, if somebody told me when I was young that I wouldn&#8217;t be an actress my entire life, I would have told them they were insane. I, to me, I write very dialogue heavy to start with. To me, writing is not much different than acting, except I don&#8217;t have to like get Botox and stuff like that. I feel like it&#8217;s about becoming somebody else, which was what acting was to me. Writing is the same thing. Diving into people, understanding motivations, situations. So it&#8217;s, for me, I think I&#8217;m happier being a writer than I ever was as an actress and I can wear sweatpants and Ugg boots and profane t-shirts and sit on my back porch, no makeup and, you know, write books. And it&#8217;s, it was a great job being a mom, too. I mean, I wrote a lot of books sitting at lacrosse practice, soccer practice, outside of the dance school. I mean, when I get stuck too, sometimes … I don&#8217;t really have writer&#8217;s block to say because I pants. So if I, if nothing&#8217;s coming, I know I took a left turn and I should have taken a right, but I&#8217;ll go sit in my car in the driveway and write. Because there&#8217;s something, I don&#8217;t know, magical about a car to me and writing. There you go. That&#8217;s how I started. And so I started traditionally, and then I went indie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>05:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is fascinating. I love the concept. Because when you&#8217;re acting, if you&#8217;re in a theatrical production, then obviously you&#8217;ve got to be at a specific space for rehearsals, for all of those things. When you&#8217;re doing other kinds of acting, where you have to be on set. But then all of a sudden, you&#8217;re on your own. And you can set your own schedule. You can be creative when you want to, or when you need to, right? Sitting at practice trying to fill in some space. I love that, I love the parallel, but it certainly gives you more control. And then I wonder, so I&#8217;m curious about, so you were with a major publisher, obviously very successful at pitching and writing the books that they wanted. But then you moved to indie. So was it that additional control that you were looking for? What was it that led you to explore the the indie author community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll be extremely blunt. Financially speaking. I had a fantastic artistic experience traditionally. Loved my editor, loved the process, learned a whole lot. But the money was bad. I was, you know, an unpublished author, my contracts weren&#8217;t great. Also, my passion is paranormal. And at that point, traditional publishing was saying vampires are dead, no pun intended there. You know, and that&#8217;s what I wanted to write. And I was like, alright, screw this. I&#8217;ll put it up myself. And I was also in this group of amazing women, my writer&#8217;s group in Kentucky. I can&#8217;t stress enough for authors, having a group of people is invaluable. And I thought, and they were strong, supportive, amazing women who I&#8217;m still very good friends with, and would not be where I am without those friends. And I thought all female writers were like that. I was wrong. However, this group in particular had started going indie. So I was learning about this and watching it, and I thought, well, hell, I&#8217;m going to do it too. But I had this group of support, where we kind of went together, and it was fantastic. And I don&#8217;t regret it at all. I never burned bridges. I&#8217;ll never say I won&#8217;t ever write traditional again. I&#8217;ve been offered traditional contracts again, but quite honestly, financially speaking, that would be a stupid move on my part. But again, I never say never, you know? Diversification is not a bad thing. And in the landscape of publishing, which is forever changing and changes on a dime, you have to go with it. It&#8217;s like a puzzle. And so that&#8217;s where I am right now. I would call myself 100% indie right now. But, you know, if something came along …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that leads me to want to ask the question, inquiring minds want to know. What would it, what kind of contract, what kind of offer would be something you would actually take seriously?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm, I don&#8217;t want to say numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even thinking it&#8217;d be certain clauses, or what rights you get to keep maybe? That&#8217;s what I would be thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well I, look, I did my traditional contract with an entertainment lawyer initially, and not an agent. And so I kept my film rights. My first book that I ever wrote got optioned for a film. Now, it&#8217;s sitting on a shelf somewhere. But it&#8217;s still under option, I&#8217;m still getting paid for that. It&#8217;s probably never gonna see the light of day as a film. However, I would want to keep my film rights, I&#8217;d want to keep my audio rights. And I would want an advance that shows that they have great faith in the book. I mean, an advance is a loan for the most part, if you really think about stuff, or can be. So that is an indication of how serious someone would take wanting to promote your writing. I really, I don&#8217;t care if my books are in … I got offered a very bad deal at a place where they kept pushing that my books would be in Walmart, and that would be great. But I also don&#8217;t care. I mean, I can make a lot more doing what I&#8217;m doing. So does that kind of answer that question?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, see, I was thinking it would be a thing where, you know, you keep you keep the film rights, keep the audio rights, keep the ebook rights. And you say, well, if you want the mass market rights, I&#8217;ll give you those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what, nobody&#8217;s gonna do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know. Not yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. No, not with me. So and I am, I&#8217;m doing pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Awesome. So let&#8217;s talk about that. I&#8217;m really excited about that. So you had this deal of three books with a major publisher, decided to go indie. What was the first move you took, in order to, obviously listening to this wonderful group. Was it a local writers&#8217; group, or … ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were originally a group of Romance Writers of America. It was one of the chapters. But at that time, back in around 2013-ish or so. And it&#8217;s changed. It&#8217;s definitely changed over time. But the feelings about indie writers were not positive. They were thought of as lesser-than. So this group left the Romance Writers of America and just formed their own thing. So that&#8217;s how it initially, that&#8217;s how I found it. I just went online. Because I promised myself once I read finished something, I would join a group of writers. But that was my, I always do that, I have lists. I&#8217;m a list maker. I never finished any of my lists, but I have ton of them. But that was on my list. If you finish this book, you can go join a group of other women. And that&#8217;s what I did. And that&#8217;s how all that started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, cool. Cool. Now I have to, I know we&#8217;re gonna take questions from the live audience a little bit later. But I have to, this comment from Lexi Green says, &#8220;All you pantsers. Share this magic, please.&#8221; Now, I think Lexi is referring to you going in to pitch the book, going, okay, I gotta come up with something and pitch it to them. So that also begs the question, pantser or plotter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>100% pantser. Because …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re a list maker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m a list maker of like, stuff—I almost said a bad word—I have to do. If I plot a book, I won&#8217;t write it. The hardest part of a book for me to write is the end because I already know what has to happen. There&#8217;s a magic for me that happens in not knowing what comes next. And then, you know, as you write, when things click, and you realize, oh my god, in chapter three, I left myself some enormous present that paid off in chapter 10. And it&#8217;s, I&#8217;ll just say, it&#8217;s like almost as good as an orgasm, is when like, puzzle pieces click, there&#8217;s so … that for me is the joy. I mean, I know who the characters are. I know, when I start a book, it&#8217;s not like I sit down and have no effing idea what I&#8217;m doing. I know probably what will happen, generally speaking, but I&#8217;ll tell you, as I write, that 360s itself several times during the process, and it surprises even me, which, you know, then I have to write more to see what the heck happens. So it&#8217;s not for everybody, everybody&#8217;s writing process is what it is, and whatever works for you is fantastic. But that&#8217;s what works for me. If I had something down where I knew what I had to write in each chapter, it would feel like an assignment for me, and the magic would go away. And I still am always shocked, I&#8217;m always shocked when it clicks together. And it does, somehow it has. Knock on some wood for God&#8217;s sakes. But that&#8217;s, yeah, that&#8217;s my process. And that&#8217;s why, and then it seems, that&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t seem much different than acting, because it&#8217;s, you discover all this stuff as you go. And that&#8217;s where I find my joy and it&#8217;s why I still do it passionately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy improv when you did stage?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did. I loved it. Loved it. Did a lot of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can imagine. And that resonates with me, because again, I very rarely know what I&#8217;m going to write other than a high level view. And then yeah, magic happens right? You sit down and it happens. For some reason, thank goodness, it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank God. I keep thinking oh my God, is this the last one I&#8217;m ever gonna have? Every time I write a book I&#8217;m like, oh my God, is this the last one? But there&#8217;s something about that fear that lights a fire under your butt too. Yeah, that&#8217;s probably not the healthiest way to live. But that&#8217;s how I live. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are you driven by deadline? So you, for example, like hey, I will take a look at your book that you&#8217;ve just pitched. Okay, I&#8217;ve got three weeks to write it. Are you driven by deadline? Do you hire your editors in advance and all of that stuff to make sure that you can stick to that plan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, my list that I make is always way overly ambitious, like if I make out what I&#8217;d like to do for this year. I have lately, more this year and last year been driven by deadlines, because I put, and I don&#8217;t always do this because I don&#8217;t like to put myself in a hole. But I&#8217;ve done pre-orders of the next book. And so that in itself is a deadline of when you have to get it done. Plus, I have a deal for audio where the audio comes out with it. So the book has to be done even earlier. So those deadlines have not been the most enjoyable things. I&#8217;d rather write what I want to write when I want to write it. However, the series that I have ongoing, I still feel great passion for so it&#8217;s easy to jump. But yeah, so generally. Yeah. Yes, I can be very driven by a deadline. I&#8217;m very, I am a prolific person. And I do write very fast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;ve talked about the magic that happens in the creative process for you. We&#8217;ve talked about humor, because you do leverage humor, obviously, in this interview, and you talked about doing that in your pitch for example. You write magic and humor a lot. I mean, a lot of that, right? So is that something that just comes natural to you is writing in that genre?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the lack of rules. I like all the tropes. I think they&#8217;re interesting. But then I like to turn a trope to fit me and my imagination. So my vampires, you know, don&#8217;t necessarily burn in the sun. They, you know, I like to play with what&#8217;s there and make it mine. Whatever&#8217;s in my imagination, so, and the lack of … Because when I, the traditional series I wrote was contemporary. And, but they were still searching for Bigfoot in one of them. I mean, I can&#8217;t help myself. I have an obsession with Bigfoot. So there&#8217;s, um, yeah, I think it&#8217;s the lack of rules and that you can do anything you want is extremely, that appeals to me. I think that&#8217;s why I feel passion for paranormal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Awesome. So you launched your original series, Magic and Mayhem. That was a standalone Robyn Peterman series of books. And then what happened that allowed you to want to open it up to other writers and work with other writers in the Magic and Mayhem Universe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I already had, I don&#8217;t know, four or five books in that series. There are 10 now. And Amazon approached me, they had a program called Kindle Worlds at the time. And they approached me about that specific series, and it becoming a Kindle World. And I was like, mmm. And so we talked a whole bunch. And I did that, I did the Kindle Worlds. And I think maybe for two years, it was a Kindle World. And then all of a sudden, and I heard about this on social media, Kindle Worlds ended. And so that was a surprise. And so there were all these books that had my IP in them still, written by other people, because what a Kindle world was, and it&#8217;s the same thing as with Universes, to a certain degree. It&#8217;s similar to fan fiction. They&#8217;re taking their own stories and putting elements of, the town that my series takes place in is called Ass Jacket, West Virginia. So they&#8217;re taking either the town or some of my characters, and they&#8217;re weaving it into their stories. Some are very, very connected, some are loosely connected. So that ended and I told all the women and some men who had written in my Kindle World, that if you want to take your books back, please do. Just remove my IP, I will help you promote it. I said, or, if you want to hang on, hold them. I&#8217;m in talks with Draft2Digital. And I said, I&#8217;m going to continue in a different way with a contract for you guys. And but if you&#8217;ll hang on, and then I was talking with Dan, and I started with all you guys, and we actually helped you guys develop the contract that we would use. And then I have my own contract, and it&#8217;s much better for the authors who do this. And I have people who have written series within the series. Some people are up to 11 books, 16 books, people have stayed with me because I make it really fun, I work really hard, and it&#8217;s been, I kind of run a really well-oiled militaristic marketing machine for it. But on the same note, we also provide them with everything. They write their book, they do their cover, they get it edited. Everything else is provided. And then because you guys are my partner, it has made it very, very doable. Very easy. I will say, Tara, my best yet Draft2Digital, is a goddess, a goddess. So that&#8217;s how I continued and it became wide, the price point was higher. What the authors got was more, they are with me, after a three-year stint, they&#8217;re welcome to take their book back if they want to, take out my IP, republish on their own. Nobody&#8217;s done that. Because we, I also work really hard on making sure their backlist continues to sell. And I make money off of this too, and it helps sell my original series. So it&#8217;s a large undertaking, and I almost feel like I have a publishing company, in partnership with you guys, aside from my own series, that I write on my own. However, I enjoy the heck out of it, because, and it&#8217;s invite only. I invite people and people have approached me. And if it&#8217;s a great fit, I welcome them into my sandbox. And luckily so, and I say this with humility, even though it might not sound humble, but I have a long waiting list of people who have asked to join it and you can&#8217;t let it get out of control or it ceases to be special. So that&#8217;s kind of what it is. And we come out twice a year, every June, every October, every April, once women and men have a certain amount of books we put out collections of, there&#8217;s three books. We are doing something brand new that I&#8217;ve told you about. But I&#8217;m gonna still keep it a secret Mark for a little bit, come next August, because you and I might do a docu-podcast about it. And it might blow up in my face in a really skanky, ugly way. But we&#8217;ll see. it&#8217;ll be funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That increases the ratings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Watch this. Watch this become a show. But yeah, so that&#8217;s what it is. I take it very seriously. I take people&#8217;s participation very seriously. And I make sure they&#8217;re treated like I would want to be treated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Awesome. And so again, I&#8217;m gonna pop up another comment. This is from Ronnie who says, &#8220;It&#8217;s always fun with you, Robyn.&#8221; Because that is one of the other things is, it is a fun process. It&#8217;s very organized. It&#8217;s very strategic. But it&#8217;s also fun, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s me, I don&#8217;t have other people run my stuff. I do it. And I have relationships. I, my God, I have so many relationships with … and see, you can&#8217;t pay for cross promotion. Cross promotion is one of the most valuable things an author can have, especially if it&#8217;s same similar genre. And those are things you can&#8217;t pay for. And that&#8217;s what this does. There have been friendships that have been developed between people who are writing my universe that didn&#8217;t know each other that then go on. I mean, they&#8217;re all, it&#8217;s a positive experience. You know, I make sure, if I feel bitchy about something, nobody hears about it. Except my husband. You know, I treat people like I would want to be treated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the way that this works is, for people who work in your universe, when they go to set up a book, in Draft2Digital, they&#8217;ve already been granted the ability to be part of the Magic and Mayhem Universe. So when they go to publish a book, they identify it as a Magic and Mayhem Universe book. And then what happens, just so people can understand who have never participated in this, which would probably be most authors. Because it&#8217;s in your universe, you keep a portion of the sales of that author&#8217;s book, the author gets paid directly by D2D, you get paid directly by D2D. And that way you don&#8217;t need to worry about getting these spreadsheets from 16 different libraries and retailers and then going okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the only way I would have done it. It&#8217;s the only that was something that wouldn&#8217;t take up my entire life. Having you guys as a partner that you guys do the royalty divide, you do the tax paperwork, you do the distribution. We&#8217;re all making money. And that was the only way I would do this. There were some people that took their Kindle Worlds and did it completely on their own. But that means hiring tax people, that means hiring payroll, so to me, that was a no-go, which is why I wanted so much for it to work out with us in being able to go forward, which it did. In such an open, I will say that, because I didn&#8217;t want a contract that looked anything like what we had had before with Kindle Worlds. Because I didn&#8217;t, it wasn&#8217;t good. There was no, the fact that I got so many people to write for me while it was a Kindle World kind of surprised me because it wasn&#8217;t a great deal. And you didn&#8217;t own your stuff. And so I wanted all that different. And that&#8217;s actually, the person who wrote my personal contract writes in my universe. And she&#8217;s a mentor, Renee Michael, she&#8217;s a huge mentor to me. And when I gave her the bullet points of what I wanted my personal contract for the writers to be, she goes, okay, this is fantastic for the people writing in your universe, and it kind of sucks for you. Let&#8217;s fix this. I was like, okay. So, you know, so everything&#8217;s out front, the contract was actually written by someone who&#8217;s having to abide by it. So it&#8217;s it all, it feels comfortable to everybody. I wanted that to be clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to say, also, you&#8217;re not the only one who loves Tara. She&#8217;s very well regarded inside and outside the company. But also, you know, thank you as well, because it&#8217;s feedback and details like that, from authors, you know, strategic business partners like yourself, that help Draft2Digital create things. Because you know, you had an issue, you had a problem, you had something that you needed to do. And we kind of collaborated together to come up with that. So thank you, because that has also helped other authors in a similar situation to yourself and people who wanted to write in other universes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan was instrumental in that. And he was way open to hearing everything. And we went through several versions of stuff before we all thought it was good. And he was great. It was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why he just continually rises up in the ranks of Draft2Digital. And why I always buy him beer when we&#8217;re together. But so I have to ask, so you&#8217;re writing, you enjoy the writing, you have a lot of fun with the stories, you have a lot of fun with the collaborations, the partnerships. Where I would worry or I&#8217;m worried for you is running this business and managing this empire, this Magic and Mayhem Universe for so many different authors. How and where does Robyn find the time for her own writing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dude, if you talk to anyone in my family, I have a balance problem. I write all the time. I write all the time. I also have, I don&#8217;t even like the word assistant. I like, there&#8217;s a gal who works with me, her name is Wanda. I call her my magic Wanda. She does all of my graphic material. And so we work our asses off around when the, you know, the universes are coming out, because we provide preorder material, release material, we do that work all year round. I am a good multitasker, I would say. And I also, I&#8217;ve been doing the universe for a while now. So we, Wanda and I and also Tara and I, we have developed what works. Because we, you know, boo-boos happen. We&#8217;ve had people upload the wrong book. We&#8217;ve had people upload the wrong cover. And so we have a system now where they give them to me first. And then Wanda goes through them to make sure that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s supposed to be. We check their back matter, their front matter. So it all looks very professional. And then Tara and I spend a day together and Tara uploads. So we have worked out what works for us, which is why Tara also gets an Edible Arrangement after every universe launch, because she can backdoor boo-boos. And so yeah, so you know what, Mark? Because I&#8217;ve been doing it for a while, I know what has to be done. But then I&#8217;m always trying to think of one new thing per, and that&#8217;s what I do with my own career too is, what has nobody done yet? And I don&#8217;t have, I have zero fear of failing. Look, if you fear failure, you&#8217;re not going to do anything. If something doesn&#8217;t work, it doesn&#8217;t work. So what? I&#8217;ll do something else. My dad, who&#8217;s hilarious and a real renegade, told my brothers and myself, he goes, make them love you, make them hate you, don&#8217;t let them forget you. And so that&#8217;s just kind of my motto in life. I mean, my work, my business, I have people that are rabid. I have people that can&#8217;t stand me, but rarely would they forget it. So that&#8217;s what I do. So anyway, yeah, I don&#8217;t know how I do everything. I joke that I run a corporation on my back porch in sweatpants with crappy internet, which is the truth. And yeah, sometimes do I feel overwhelmed? Absolutely, absolutely. But um, I can&#8217;t think of a better job than what I have. I love it. As much as I love acting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fantastic. So, you release, you do two major releases in this universe every year. One of them is …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now. This Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Monday, you&nbsp;launched how many books? Can you talk a little bit about what&#8217;s out there now?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, 14 came out. And I actually have started releasing with my universe now, because I have several other series going. And we have 14 books out. If you look at any of my social media, it&#8217;s all over it. We have our own website, magicandmayhemuniverse.com. And, yeah, it&#8217;s kicking, and I don&#8217;t know. I mean, I&#8217;m in the middle of it. I mean, I was laughing. I was like, oh my God, this week is the hairiest week I have this year so far. But um, what do you want to know? They&#8217;re hilarious. It&#8217;s amazing women. We&#8217;re all over the place. You can check out Magic and Mayhem Universe on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, on Pinterest. Our social media is fantastic and heavy. And I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;re having fun. We&#8217;re still, there&#8217;s a feature on each of those authors every day now on Facebook, where you can get to know everybody. We had a massive release day in my fan room, where all my authors did takeovers, and it was nuts, and there were prizes, and it was crazy. It&#8217;s just fun. It&#8217;s fun. Everybody&#8217;s having fun. It&#8217;s easy. And the books are great, so read them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that. I love that. Now I&#8217;m gonna start to pop up some comments and questions from the live audience. So this is what Lynn just wanted to share. &#8220;Hi, so excited to hear your voice and see your face.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lynn has a book. Lynn is in England. And we haven&#8217;t spoken spoken. We talk all the time via this. And she&#8217;s a doll, she&#8217;s a terrific writer, and she should be checked out. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Comment from Virginia is that, &#8220;&#8216;Vanity&#8217; is what they used to call us, back before indie was taken seriously.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virginia is correct. And Virginia also writes for the Universe. She&#8217;s not in this particular launch. But she is a repeat writer in there, she&#8217;s a fabulous human. And she&#8217;s right, it was called vanity press. But that&#8217;s when you would get print books ordered and sell them out of the trunk of your car. But no, independent publishing are real authors. They&#8217;re some fabulous authors. And it&#8217;s a real business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome, awesome. Now I do have a question from our very own Elyssa at Draft2Digital. She says, &#8220;I have to respect the hustle. I want to hear more about this well-oiled marketing machine. Can you share some secret sauce, Robyn?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say, nobody&#8217;s gonna want to hear this part. But it&#8217;s the person who&#8217;s running it actually being involved. Seriously, hands on is very important. Because then I think that it creates an atmosphere where people feel cared about, willing to go the extra mile. I mean, the authors who write for me, it&#8217;s me. And they know it&#8217;s me, and I make a plan, I am anally clear with directions. We do coordinated newsletter blasts, coordinated preorder newsletter blasts. We have, I mean, I give them dates, days that things are to be used, you know, we do … I think that clear directions and a hands on approach. And see, there are tons of things that Wanda and I do that they don&#8217;t see. Wanda and I spend days figuring out color schemes and backgrounds and we do puzzle covers and we do gifs and we do trailers, you know, and we pick out together, I mean Wanda does that physical work because I don&#8217;t have any desire to learn it, but I know what I like. It&#8217;s like, I will never be a cover artist because that&#8217;s not my forte, but I see very clearly what I want things to look like, I just can&#8217;t physically do it. So there&#8217;s a buttload of work that goes into it. But I would say, hands on. And I would also say branding is a very important part. If you look at something that we put out, it is really clear, really clear. And I don&#8217;t require the gals who write, gals and guys who write in my universe, to use a certain cover artist. They can use whoever they want. I have a list of suggestions if they need help. But they know, just taking a look at our website, they can say, okay, it&#8217;s in this flavor, or look at the original series and know the flavor that these kind of books look like. But then as far as like, the branding on my side goes, for what our materials look like, that&#8217;s extremely important too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the branding is, that&#8217;s not just the look and feel, like the recommended artists. It&#8217;s the logo, you&#8217;ve got the Magic and Mayhem logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and we put that on, so it doesn&#8217;t end up warped, or, like, you know. They have a cover template that knows, this corner&#8217;s open. So, you know, I mean, those are like the little inner underneath things that you wouldn&#8217;t really think about. But since we&#8217;ve been doing it for a while, we know all that, you know? We use the links from our website when we promote so that you go to the website. So then if a reader is there for a certain author, and they go oh, wait a minute, look, that looks really cute. So that&#8217;s another way of cross promotion. You know, it&#8217;s, I think this through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. Awesome. I love that. So I guess I&#8217;m curious about the communication. So you had had 14 books that were released this month. Obviously there was a lot of work leading up to that, a lot of different moving parts. Are you using, how are you communicating? You said you weren&#8217;t talking to Lynn by email, or by phone? Is it mostly email? How do you coordinate all this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook, baby. Yeah, private rooms on Facebook. And I do one per launch. So it&#8217;s just us in there. It&#8217;s not an ongoing from prior. It&#8217;s just us. All the information is in there. We sing happy, you know, it&#8217;s happy birthday when it&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s birthday. And people can put whatever they want to put in there. But that&#8217;s the cleanest way. And then I use email and stuff as well, because Facebook warps, you know, graphics. But yeah, it&#8217;s a Facebook room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Awesome. We have a question, a creative question from Virginia. Virginia asks you, &#8220;What triggers a story for you? For example, what bites you and makes you want to tell a particular story?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a good question. My brain is really crowded. And if I didn&#8217;t write I would probably need to be institutionalized. There&#8217;s so much, and I have a folder on the computer, but it&#8217;s like the start of a kajillion different things and it&#8217;s thoughts. And so I don&#8217;t … you know, I can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s no one thing. I mean, you know, I have on-running series. I have the Hot Damn series, I have Magic and Mayhem series, I have Good to the Last Death, and I have Magical Midlife series. So I have four on-running series. So I kind of know that I&#8217;m going to hit each of those, at least in semi the kind of order. So it&#8217;s just me, I guess it&#8217;s just being back with those characters. I always reread the last book from that series before I start a new one. Because my worlds have so many different rules, I have to get back into that head and that voice. And then I just usually get excited and go okay, what&#8217;s gonna happen to them? Let&#8217;s see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. I love that. So you had mentioned earlier, sometimes you needed that change of atmosphere, change of pace. Sometimes you did the car you found is a really great place for inspiration. So I need to ask, is the actual mechanical process of writing, is it on a keyboard? Do you do notepad and pen, dictation? How do you do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t do dictation. I tried that and that was a hot mess. I write on the computer and I also handwrite. Like if something is like not working, there&#8217;s something about a really sharp, and I use Ticonderoga. It&#8217;s not a commercial for them but those are the pencils I like, really sharp, and a yellow legal pad. Okay, here&#8217;s a scary story. When I pitched, when I was an actor, I was very fortunate. I was never a household name, but I was always a working actor. I didn&#8217;t know how to type. I never took typing in high school like a dumbass. When I was in college, you could pay your, you know, suitemate five bucks to type your term papers. And that&#8217;s what I did. And so I also learned how to type. When I wrote that book, I hand wrote that 95k word book, and then I sat down and I typed it, which was probably why I got the shingles. But, um, and shingles suck. But, yes, so, yes, I type now. My kids laugh because I do not type correctly. But I&#8217;m like, you know what, you&#8217;re going to college, so shut up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a single finger typer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m more than one finger, but I have to look at the keyboard. And so but sometimes, if it&#8217;s not happening, there&#8217;s something about holding a pencil. And there&#8217;s something about a connection to paper that will sometimes break something for me, break through something for me. And so that makes sense. So those are the two ways that I write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome, awesome, thank you so much. So Lexi&#8217;s asking a question about the Universes. So, &#8220;With multiple writers creating in your universe, are there ways that they can specifically interact with or not interact with together to affect the greater universe as a whole?&#8221; Like, I guess the rules?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you can&#8217;t kill my characters. They see that right up front. You can&#8217;t kill my characters. Um, you know, what a lot of people, some of the people that have been extremely successful, I would say, with sales, because I think you&#8217;re successful if you write a book, quite honestly. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to do. They have mixed their own series characters that are already popular with their people, and brought them in, and mixed them up with mine. And then for a lot of those people, it&#8217;s turned into a running little series within the series. Yeah, I have a rule you don&#8217;t kill my characters. And that has been fine. I mean, don&#8217;t go make anybody pregnant or this or that or anything. And a lot of people too, there&#8217;s a character, Zelda is the main heroine. She actually started as a very selfish, you know, magic abusing, in a funny way, witch, and then she&#8217;s got her friend Sassy, who has been working on learning to speak Canadian for a couple of books. She&#8217;s working on the languages of the world. Yeah, Canadian and British she&#8217;s having trouble with. But there are a couple characters that, she has three cats: Fat Bastard, Jango Fett, and Boba Fett, who were cats of mine, who I immortalized in this book. They&#8217;re no longer here, but they &#8220;yous guys,&#8221; they talk like this. And they lick the bowls. And they, you know, they&#8217;re, so those guys get used in a lot of people&#8217;s books. And then there&#8217;s the head witch Baba Yaga, who dresses from, you know, Madonna era, cone bras and rubber bracelets. And she&#8217;s a hoot. So those are kind of my characters that tend to get dropped into other people&#8217;s stories. Or they&#8217;ll use Ass Jacket, West Virginia, and something will go on there. So yeah, the only rule I have is you can&#8217;t kill my characters. And then the second part of that question, how these women are communicating with each other, is in the Facebook group. And a lot of them, actually a lot of people that write in my universe are actually good friends of mine, who are just amazing authors. And then some of the newer people, newer friends that I have, have been recommendations from other people, or they&#8217;ve approached me themselves, with a really, usually hilarious pitch. That&#8217;s like, I really want to write and here&#8217;s why. But then I look at them in the genre that they write. Because if somebody writes, you know, horror, and has a following that way, that doesn&#8217;t really fit. You know, there are a couple rules, it&#8217;s not erotica. I don&#8217;t erotica is great. You know, that&#8217;s, but that&#8217;s not what the series is. They need to read my series and make sure they connect to it, and can write enough fun. It doesn&#8217;t have to match my stuff. But it has to be a fun, comedic, paranormal. Happily ever after at the end. Like, another rule, there&#8217;s no menage in this, in these particular series. Menage books are great. It&#8217;s not what the Magic and Mayhem that I write is about. So those are some of the rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome, thank you. So we have less than a minute left. But I did want to pop this up from Ace Adams who asks, &#8220;Do you ever feel overwhelmed and wonder which project to pull out of the pile to work on?&#8221; And I guess maybe the question there is, do you ever feel overwhelmed and how do you deal with that? Like, how do you, what do you pull out first?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I do feel overwhelmed and the first thing that I pull out is laundry, and the second thing … No, um, yeah, but like I said, I&#8217;m really lucky to get to do what I do and to be able to do it. Being overwhelmed is nothing new. It&#8217;s in my personality anyway. And then I will just make my lists and check stuff off. If I don&#8217;t get to everything, I don&#8217;t get to everything. I&#8217;ll get to it to the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Well, Robyn, you know what? Oh my god, that felt like two minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did, that went really fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that was a such a fantastic conversation. Thank you so much for such an entertaining time that we got to spend this afternoon and answering questions from folks. I guess, where can people find out more about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can go to robynpeterman.com. They can go to magicandmayhemuniverse.com. I&#8217;m on Facebook. I&#8217;m on Instagram, but I&#8217;m not. I had to pick my social media. So Facebook is probably the best. There&#8217;s an author page, a personal page. There you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Thanks so much, Robyn.

This is Mark Leslie Lefevbre. I am the Director of Business Development with Draft2Digital and I&#8217;m honored to have in the virtual studio with me Robyn Peterman of the Magic and Mayhem Universe. Robyn, welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. It&#8217;s nice to be here, Mark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is awesome to get to chat with you. Now I want to get into the Magic and Mayhem Universe and all of the amazing things you&#8217;re doing. But I first want to get into—so Robyn Peterman, as a writer, when did this all start for you? How did you get into writing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a lie. Most of my grownup life, I was an actress, I was a professional actress. I&#8217;ve done Broadway, television, film. And after I had my kids, it didn&#8217;t make as much sense to me anymore. So I had to kind of refigure out what I wanted to do. And I&#8217;d always written. I used to do, I used to punch up jokes when I was an actor, which means … punch up scripts, which means write jokes. And I did some for television, for film, for … and so, but I&#8217;d never finished a book ever. And I decided in my late 40s that I was going to try. I was going to write a book. I told my husband I was gonna write a book. He was like, go on with your bad self. And I did. And I sent it out everywhere and nobody wanted it. Nobody wanted it. So I joined a writers&#8217; group and went to a con, a romance convention. It was RT, which doesn&#8217;t exist anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romantic Times, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I loved that one. Anyway, I was there. I was unpublished with a couple girlfriends from Kentucky in my writing group. And there was a thing called Pitchapalooza. And it&#8217;s agents and publishers. And it&#8217;s a big room and you&#8217;ve got like, three minutes to sit down and then the bell rings, then you go to another table and you pitch. And they were looking for contemporary romance, which is not what I wrote at all. But I thought, what do I have to lose? So I made up a book.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait, on the spot you made it up?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, no, I made it up right before it all happened. So I had something in my head. And I lied, basically, and everybody was laughing and like, I would say 12 or 14 different people asked for the full manuscript. So I lied some more, and I was like, freaking out on the inside. I&#8217;m like, well, okay, I said, I have to go home and get it professionally edited—which meant write it—and then I&#8217;ll send it to you in three weeks. So I went home, and I wrote a 95k book in three weeks. I got the shingles after that, which … I don&#8217;t recommend my method. If unfortunately I had to do it again. But, and then I got offers from several different places. And I went with a three-book deal with Kensington. So I started out traditional. So my entry into publishing was based on a lie, a big, fat, hairy lie. But as an actress, I was good, you know, I was good at talking to people, pitching. I was like, wow, you know! Yes, so that is literally how I started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that. So I&#8217;ve got to ask for the parallel between going to an audition or pitching the book. Was it a very similar experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, sure. I mean, I don&#8217;t really … Look, if somebody told me when I was young that I wouldn&#8217;t be an actress my entire life, I would have told them they were insane. I, to me, I write very dialogue heavy to start with. To me, writing is not much different than acting, except I don&#8217;t have to like get Botox and stuff like that. I feel like it&#8217;s about becoming somebody else, which was what acting was to me. Writing is the same thing. Diving into people, understanding motivations, situations. So it&#8217;s, for me, I think I&#8217;m happier being a writer than I ever was as an actress and I can wear sweatpants and Ugg boots and profane t-shirts and sit on my back porch, no makeup and, you know, write books. And it&#8217;s, it was a great job being a mom, too. I mean, I wrote a lot of books sitting at lacrosse practice, soccer practice, outside of the dance school. I mean, when I get stuck too, sometimes … I don&#8217;t really have writer&#8217;s block to say because I pants. So if I, if nothing&#8217;s coming, I know I took a left turn and I should have taken a right, but I&#8217;ll go sit in my car in the driveway and write. Because there&#8217;s something, I don&#8217;t know, magical about a car to me and writing. There you go. That&#8217;s how I started. And so I started traditionally, and then I went indie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>05:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is fascinating. I love the concept. Because when you&#8217;re acting, if you&#8217;re in a theatrical production, then obviously you&#8217;ve got to be at a specific space for rehearsals, for all of those things. When you&#8217;re doing other kinds of acting, where you have to be on set. But then all of a sudden, you&#8217;re on your own. And you can set your own schedule. You can be creative when you want to, or when you need to, right? Sitting at practice trying to fill in some space. I love that, I love the parallel, but it certainly gives you more control. And then I wonder, so I&#8217;m curious about, so you were with a major publisher, obviously very successful at pitching and writing the books that they wanted. But then you moved to indie. So was it that additional control that you were looking for? What was it that led you to explore the the indie author community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll be extremely blunt. Financially speaking. I had a fantastic artistic experience traditionally. Loved my editor, loved the process, learned a whole lot. But the money was bad. I was, you know, an unpublished author, my contracts weren&#8217;t great. Also, my passion is paranormal. And at that point, traditional publishing was saying vampires are dead, no pun intended there. You know, and that&#8217;s what I wanted to write. And I was like, alright, screw this. I&#8217;ll put it up myself. And I was also in this group of amazing women, my writer&#8217;s group in Kentucky. I can&#8217;t stress enough for authors, having a group of people is invaluable. And I thought, and they were strong, supportive, amazing women who I&#8217;m still very good friends with, and would not be where I am without those friends. And I thought all female writers were like that. I was wrong. However, this group in particular had started going indie. So I was learning about this and watching it, and I thought, well, hell, I&#8217;m going to do it too. But I had this group of support, where we kind of went together, and it was fantastic. And I don&#8217;t regret it at all. I never burned bridges. I&#8217;ll never say I won&#8217;t ever write traditional again. I&#8217;ve been offered traditional contracts again, but quite honestly, financially speaking, that would be a stupid move on my part. But again, I never say never, you know? Diversification is not a bad thing. And in the landscape of publishing, which is forever changing and changes on a dime, you have to go with it. It&#8217;s like a puzzle. And so that&#8217;s where I am right now. I would call myself 100% indie right now. But, you know, if something came along …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that leads me to want to ask the question, inquiring minds want to know. What would it, what kind of contract, what kind of offer would be something you would actually take seriously?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm, I don&#8217;t want to say numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was even thinking it&#8217;d be certain clauses, or what rights you get to keep maybe? That&#8217;s what I would be thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well I, look, I did my traditional contract with an entertainment lawyer initially, and not an agent. And so I kept my film rights. My first book that I ever wrote got optioned for a film. Now, it&#8217;s sitting on a shelf somewhere. But it&#8217;s still under option, I&#8217;m still getting paid for that. It&#8217;s probably never gonna see the light of day as a film. However, I would want to keep my film rights, I&#8217;d want to keep my audio rights. And I would want an advance that shows that they have great faith in the book. I mean, an advance is a loan for the most part, if you really think about stuff, or can be. So that is an indication of how serious someone would take wanting to promote your writing. I really, I don&#8217;t care if my books are in … I got offered a very bad deal at a place where they kept pushing that my books would be in Walmart, and that would be great. But I also don&#8217;t care. I mean, I can make a lot more doing what I&#8217;m doing. So does that kind of answer that question?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, see, I was thinking it would be a thing where, you know, you keep you keep the film rights, keep the audio rights, keep the ebook rights. And you say, well, if you want the mass market rights, I&#8217;ll give you those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what, nobody&#8217;s gonna do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know. Not yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. No, not with me. So and I am, I&#8217;m doing pretty good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Awesome. So let&#8217;s talk about that. I&#8217;m really excited about that. So you had this deal of three books with a major publisher, decided to go indie. What was the first move you took, in order to, obviously listening to this wonderful group. Was it a local writers&#8217; group, or … ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were originally a group of Romance Writers of America. It was one of the chapters. But at that time, back in around 2013-ish or so. And it&#8217;s changed. It&#8217;s definitely changed over time. But the feelings about indie writers were not positive. They were thought of as lesser-than. So this group left the Romance Writers of America and just formed their own thing. So that&#8217;s how it initially, that&#8217;s how I found it. I just went online. Because I promised myself once I read finished something, I would join a group of writers. But that was my, I always do that, I have lists. I&#8217;m a list maker. I never finished any of my lists, but I have ton of them. But that was on my list. If you finish this book, you can go join a group of other women. And that&#8217;s what I did. And that&#8217;s how all that started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, cool. Cool. Now I have to, I know we&#8217;re gonna take questions from the live audience a little bit later. But I have to, this comment from Lexi Green says, &#8220;All you pantsers. Share this magic, please.&#8221; Now, I think Lexi is referring to you going in to pitch the book, going, okay, I gotta come up with something and pitch it to them. So that also begs the question, pantser or plotter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>100% pantser. Because …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re a list maker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m a list maker of like, stuff—I almost said a bad word—I have to do. If I plot a book, I won&#8217;t write it. The hardest part of a book for me to write is the end because I already know what has to happen. There&#8217;s a magic for me that happens in not knowing what comes next. And then, you know, as you write, when things click, and you realize, oh my god, in chapter three, I left myself some enormous present that paid off in chapter 10. And it&#8217;s, I&#8217;ll just say, it&#8217;s like almost as good as an orgasm, is when like, puzzle pieces click, there&#8217;s so … that for me is the joy. I mean, I know who the characters are. I know, when I start a book, it&#8217;s not like I sit down and have no effing idea what I&#8217;m doing. I know probably what will happen, generally speaking, but I&#8217;ll tell you, as I write, that 360s itself several times during the process, and it surprises even me, which, you know, then I have to write more to see what the heck happens. So it&#8217;s not for everybody, everybody&#8217;s writing process is what it is, and whatever works for you is fantastic. But that&#8217;s what works for me. If I had something down where I knew what I had to write in each chapter, it would feel like an assignment for me, and the magic would go away. And I still am always shocked, I&#8217;m always shocked when it clicks together. And it does, somehow it has. Knock on some wood for God&#8217;s sakes. But that&#8217;s, yeah, that&#8217;s my process. And that&#8217;s why, and then it seems, that&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t seem much different than acting, because it&#8217;s, you discover all this stuff as you go. And that&#8217;s where I find my joy and it&#8217;s why I still do it passionately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you enjoy improv when you did stage?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did. I loved it. Loved it. Did a lot of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can imagine. And that resonates with me, because again, I very rarely know what I&#8217;m going to write other than a high level view. And then yeah, magic happens right? You sit down and it happens. For some reason, thank goodness, it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank God. I keep thinking oh my God, is this the last one I&#8217;m ever gonna have? Every time I write a book I&#8217;m like, oh my God, is this the last one? But there&#8217;s something about that fear that lights a fire under your butt too. Yeah, that&#8217;s probably not the healthiest way to live. But that&#8217;s how I live. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are you driven by deadline? So you, for example, like hey, I will take a look at your book that you&#8217;ve just pitched. Okay, I&#8217;ve got three weeks to write it. Are you driven by deadline? Do you hire your editors in advance and all of that stuff to make sure that you can stick to that plan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>14:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, my list that I make is always way overly ambitious, like if I make out what I&#8217;d like to do for this year. I have lately, more this year and last year been driven by deadlines, because I put, and I don&#8217;t always do this because I don&#8217;t like to put myself in a hole. But I&#8217;ve done pre-orders of the next book. And so that in itself is a deadline of when you have to get it done. Plus, I have a deal for audio where the audio comes out with it. So the book has to be done even earlier. So those deadlines have not been the most enjoyable things. I&#8217;d rather write what I want to write when I want to write it. However, the series that I have ongoing, I still feel great passion for so it&#8217;s easy to jump. But yeah, so generally. Yeah. Yes, I can be very driven by a deadline. I&#8217;m very, I am a prolific person. And I do write very fast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;ve talked about the magic that happens in the creative process for you. We&#8217;ve talked about humor, because you do leverage humor, obviously, in this interview, and you talked about doing that in your pitch for example. You write magic and humor a lot. I mean, a lot of that, right? So is that something that just comes natural to you is writing in that genre?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the lack of rules. I like all the tropes. I think they&#8217;re interesting. But then I like to turn a trope to fit me and my imagination. So my vampires, you know, don&#8217;t necessarily burn in the sun. They, you know, I like to play with what&#8217;s there and make it mine. Whatever&#8217;s in my imagination, so, and the lack of … Because when I, the traditional series I wrote was contemporary. And, but they were still searching for Bigfoot in one of them. I mean, I can&#8217;t help myself. I have an obsession with Bigfoot. So there&#8217;s, um, yeah, I think it&#8217;s the lack of rules and that you can do anything you want is extremely, that appeals to me. I think that&#8217;s why I feel passion for paranormal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Awesome. So you launched your original series, Magic and Mayhem. That was a standalone Robyn Peterman series of books. And then what happened that allowed you to want to open it up to other writers and work with other writers in the Magic and Mayhem Universe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I already had, I don&#8217;t know, four or five books in that series. There are 10 now. And Amazon approached me, they had a program called Kindle Worlds at the time. And they approached me about that specific series, and it becoming a Kindle World. And I was like, mmm. And so we talked a whole bunch. And I did that, I did the Kindle Worlds. And I think maybe for two years, it was a Kindle World. And then all of a sudden, and I heard about this on social media, Kindle Worlds ended. And so that was a surprise. And so there were all these books that had my IP in them still, written by other people, because what a Kindle world was, and it&#8217;s the same thing as with Universes, to a certain degree. It&#8217;s similar to fan fiction. They&#8217;re taking their own stories and putting elements of, the town that my series takes place in is called Ass Jacket, West Virginia. So they&#8217;re taking either the town or some of my characters, and they&#8217;re weaving it into their stories. Some are very, very connected, some are loosely connected. So that ended and I told all the women and some men who had written in my Kindle World, that if you want to take your books back, please do. Just remove my IP, I will help you promote it. I said, or, if you want to hang on, hold them. I&#8217;m in talks with Draft2Digital. And I said, I&#8217;m going to continue in a different way with a contract for you guys. And but if you&#8217;ll hang on, and then I was talking with Dan, and I started with all you guys, and we actually helped you guys develop the contract that we would use. And then I have my own contract, and it&#8217;s much better for the authors who do this. And I have people who have written series within the series. Some people are up to 11 books, 16 books, people have stayed with me because I make it really fun, I work really hard, and it&#8217;s been, I kind of run a really well-oiled militaristic marketing machine for it. But on the same note, we also provide them with everything. They write their book, they do their cover, they get it edited. Everything else is provided. And then because you guys are my partner, it has made it very, very doable. Very easy. I will say, Tara, my best yet Draft2Digital, is a goddess, a goddess. So that&#8217;s how I continued and it became wide, the price point was higher. What the authors got was more, they are with me, after a three-year stint, they&#8217;re welcome to take their book back if they want to, take out my IP, republish on their own. Nobody&#8217;s done that. Because we, I also work really hard on making sure their backlist continues to sell. And I make money off of this too, and it helps sell my original series. So it&#8217;s a large undertaking, and I almost feel like I have a publishing company, in partnership with you guys, aside from my own series, that I write on my own. However, I enjoy the heck out of it, because, and it&#8217;s invite only. I invite people and people have approached me. And if it&#8217;s a great fit, I welcome them into my sandbox. And luckily so, and I say this with humility, even though it might not sound humble, but I have a long waiting list of people who have asked to join it and you can&#8217;t let it get out of control or it ceases to be special. So that&#8217;s kind of what it is. And we come out twice a year, every June, every October, every April, once women and men have a certain amount of books we put out collections of, there&#8217;s three books. We are doing something brand new that I&#8217;ve told you about. But I&#8217;m gonna still keep it a secret Mark for a little bit, come next August, because you and I might do a docu-podcast about it. And it might blow up in my face in a really skanky, ugly way. But we&#8217;ll see. it&#8217;ll be funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That increases the ratings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Watch this. Watch this become a show. But yeah, so that&#8217;s what it is. I take it very seriously. I take people&#8217;s participation very seriously. And I make sure they&#8217;re treated like I would want to be treated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Awesome. And so again, I&#8217;m gonna pop up another comment. This is from Ronnie who says, &#8220;It&#8217;s always fun with you, Robyn.&#8221; Because that is one of the other things is, it is a fun process. It&#8217;s very organized. It&#8217;s very strategic. But it&#8217;s also fun, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s me, I don&#8217;t have other people run my stuff. I do it. And I have relationships. I, my God, I have so many relationships with … and see, you can&#8217;t pay for cross promotion. Cross promotion is one of the most valuable things an author can have, especially if it&#8217;s same similar genre. And those are things you can&#8217;t pay for. And that&#8217;s what this does. There have been friendships that have been developed between people who are writing my universe that didn&#8217;t know each other that then go on. I mean, they&#8217;re all, it&#8217;s a positive experience. You know, I make sure, if I feel bitchy about something, nobody hears about it. Except my husband. You know, I treat people like I would want to be treated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>23:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the way that this works is, for people who work in your universe, when they go to set up a book, in Draft2Digital, they&#8217;ve already been granted the ability to be part of the Magic and Mayhem Universe. So when they go to publish a book, they identify it as a Magic and Mayhem Universe book. And then what happens, just so people can understand who have never participated in this, which would probably be most authors. Because it&#8217;s in your universe, you keep a portion of the sales of that author&#8217;s book, the author gets paid directly by D2D, you get paid directly by D2D. And that way you don&#8217;t need to worry about getting these spreadsheets from 16 different libraries and retailers and then going okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the only way I would have done it. It&#8217;s the only that was something that wouldn&#8217;t take up my entire life. Having you guys as a partner that you guys do the royalty divide, you do the tax paperwork, you do the distribution. We&#8217;re all making money. And that was the only way I would do this. There were some people that took their Kindle Worlds and did it completely on their own. But that means hiring tax people, that means hiring payroll, so to me, that was a no-go, which is why I wanted so much for it to work out with us in being able to go forward, which it did. In such an open, I will say that, because I didn&#8217;t want a contract that looked anything like what we had had before with Kindle Worlds. Because I didn&#8217;t, it wasn&#8217;t good. There was no, the fact that I got so many people to write for me while it was a Kindle World kind of surprised me because it wasn&#8217;t a great deal. And you didn&#8217;t own your stuff. And so I wanted all that different. And that&#8217;s actually, the person who wrote my personal contract writes in my universe. And she&#8217;s a mentor, Renee Michael, she&#8217;s a huge mentor to me. And when I gave her the bullet points of what I wanted my personal contract for the writers to be, she goes, okay, this is fantastic for the people writing in your universe, and it kind of sucks for you. Let&#8217;s fix this. I was like, okay. So, you know, so everything&#8217;s out front, the contract was actually written by someone who&#8217;s having to abide by it. So it&#8217;s it all, it feels comfortable to everybody. I wanted that to be clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to say, also, you&#8217;re not the only one who loves Tara. She&#8217;s very well regarded inside and outside the company. But also, you know, thank you as well, because it&#8217;s feedback and details like that, from authors, you know, strategic business partners like yourself, that help Draft2Digital create things. Because you know, you had an issue, you had a problem, you had something that you needed to do. And we kind of collaborated together to come up with that. So thank you, because that has also helped other authors in a similar situation to yourself and people who wanted to write in other universes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>26:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan was instrumental in that. And he was way open to hearing everything. And we went through several versions of stuff before we all thought it was good. And he was great. It was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why he just continually rises up in the ranks of Draft2Digital. And why I always buy him beer when we&#8217;re together. But so I have to ask, so you&#8217;re writing, you enjoy the writing, you have a lot of fun with the stories, you have a lot of fun with the collaborations, the partnerships. Where I would worry or I&#8217;m worried for you is running this business and managing this empire, this Magic and Mayhem Universe for so many different authors. How and where does Robyn find the time for her own writing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dude, if you talk to anyone in my family, I have a balance problem. I write all the time. I write all the time. I also have, I don&#8217;t even like the word assistant. I like, there&#8217;s a gal who works with me, her name is Wanda. I call her my magic Wanda. She does all of my graphic material. And so we work our asses off around when the, you know, the universes are coming out, because we provide preorder material, release material, we do that work all year round. I am a good multitasker, I would say. And I also, I&#8217;ve been doing the universe for a while now. So we, Wanda and I and also Tara and I, we have developed what works. Because we, you know, boo-boos happen. We&#8217;ve had people upload the wrong book. We&#8217;ve had people upload the wrong cover. And so we have a system now where they give them to me first. And then Wanda goes through them to make sure that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s supposed to be. We check their back matter, their front matter. So it all looks very professional. And then Tara and I spend a day together and Tara uploads. So we have worked out what works for us, which is why Tara also gets an Edible Arrangement after every universe launch, because she can backdoor boo-boos. And so yeah, so you know what, Mark? Because I&#8217;ve been doing it for a while, I know what has to be done. But then I&#8217;m always trying to think of one new thing per, and that&#8217;s what I do with my own career too is, what has nobody done yet? And I don&#8217;t have, I have zero fear of failing. Look, if you fear failure, you&#8217;re not going to do anything. If something doesn&#8217;t work, it doesn&#8217;t work. So what? I&#8217;ll do something else. My dad, who&#8217;s hilarious and a real renegade, told my brothers and myself, he goes, make them love you, make them hate you, don&#8217;t let them forget you. And so that&#8217;s just kind of my motto in life. I mean, my work, my business, I have people that are rabid. I have people that can&#8217;t stand me, but rarely would they forget it. So that&#8217;s what I do. So anyway, yeah, I don&#8217;t know how I do everything. I joke that I run a corporation on my back porch in sweatpants with crappy internet, which is the truth. And yeah, sometimes do I feel overwhelmed? Absolutely, absolutely. But um, I can&#8217;t think of a better job than what I have. I love it. As much as I love acting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fantastic. So, you release, you do two major releases in this universe every year. One of them is …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now. This Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Monday, you&nbsp;launched how many books? Can you talk a little bit about what&#8217;s out there now?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, 14 came out. And I actually have started releasing with my universe now, because I have several other series going. And we have 14 books out. If you look at any of my social media, it&#8217;s all over it. We have our own website, magicandmayhemuniverse.com. And, yeah, it&#8217;s kicking, and I don&#8217;t know. I mean, I&#8217;m in the middle of it. I mean, I was laughing. I was like, oh my God, this week is the hairiest week I have this year so far. But um, what do you want to know? They&#8217;re hilarious. It&#8217;s amazing women. We&#8217;re all over the place. You can check out Magic and Mayhem Universe on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, on Pinterest. Our social media is fantastic and heavy. And I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;re having fun. We&#8217;re still, there&#8217;s a feature on each of those authors every day now on Facebook, where you can get to know everybody. We had a massive release day in my fan room, where all my authors did takeovers, and it was nuts, and there were prizes, and it was crazy. It&#8217;s just fun. It&#8217;s fun. Everybody&#8217;s having fun. It&#8217;s easy. And the books are great, so read them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that. I love that. Now I&#8217;m gonna start to pop up some comments and questions from the live audience. So this is what Lynn just wanted to share. &#8220;Hi, so excited to hear your voice and see your face.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lynn has a book. Lynn is in England. And we haven&#8217;t spoken spoken. We talk all the time via this. And she&#8217;s a doll, she&#8217;s a terrific writer, and she should be checked out. Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Comment from Virginia is that, &#8220;&#8216;Vanity&#8217; is what they used to call us, back before indie was taken seriously.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virginia is correct. And Virginia also writes for the Universe. She&#8217;s not in this particular launch. But she is a repeat writer in there, she&#8217;s a fabulous human. And she&#8217;s right, it was called vanity press. But that&#8217;s when you would get print books ordered and sell them out of the trunk of your car. But no, independent publishing are real authors. They&#8217;re some fabulous authors. And it&#8217;s a real business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome, awesome. Now I do have a question from our very own Elyssa at Draft2Digital. She says, &#8220;I have to respect the hustle. I want to hear more about this well-oiled marketing machine. Can you share some secret sauce, Robyn?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>33:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say, nobody&#8217;s gonna want to hear this part. But it&#8217;s the person who&#8217;s running it actually being involved. Seriously, hands on is very important. Because then I think that it creates an atmosphere where people feel cared about, willing to go the extra mile. I mean, the authors who write for me, it&#8217;s me. And they know it&#8217;s me, and I make a plan, I am anally clear with directions. We do coordinated newsletter blasts, coordinated preorder newsletter blasts. We have, I mean, I give them dates, days that things are to be used, you know, we do … I think that clear directions and a hands on approach. And see, there are tons of things that Wanda and I do that they don&#8217;t see. Wanda and I spend days figuring out color schemes and backgrounds and we do puzzle covers and we do gifs and we do trailers, you know, and we pick out together, I mean Wanda does that physical work because I don&#8217;t have any desire to learn it, but I know what I like. It&#8217;s like, I will never be a cover artist because that&#8217;s not my forte, but I see very clearly what I want things to look like, I just can&#8217;t physically do it. So there&#8217;s a buttload of work that goes into it. But I would say, hands on. And I would also say branding is a very important part. If you look at something that we put out, it is really clear, really clear. And I don&#8217;t require the gals who write, gals and guys who write in my universe, to use a certain cover artist. They can use whoever they want. I have a list of suggestions if they need help. But they know, just taking a look at our website, they can say, okay, it&#8217;s in this flavor, or look at the original series and know the flavor that these kind of books look like. But then as far as like, the branding on my side goes, for what our materials look like, that&#8217;s extremely important too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So the branding is, that&#8217;s not just the look and feel, like the recommended artists. It&#8217;s the logo, you&#8217;ve got the Magic and Mayhem logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and we put that on, so it doesn&#8217;t end up warped, or, like, you know. They have a cover template that knows, this corner&#8217;s open. So, you know, I mean, those are like the little inner underneath things that you wouldn&#8217;t really think about. But since we&#8217;ve been doing it for a while, we know all that, you know? We use the links from our website when we promote so that you go to the website. So then if a reader is there for a certain author, and they go oh, wait a minute, look, that looks really cute. So that&#8217;s another way of cross promotion. You know, it&#8217;s, I think this through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. Awesome. I love that. So I guess I&#8217;m curious about the communication. So you had had 14 books that were released this month. Obviously there was a lot of work leading up to that, a lot of different moving parts. Are you using, how are you communicating? You said you weren&#8217;t talking to Lynn by email, or by phone? Is it mostly email? How do you coordinate all this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook, baby. Yeah, private rooms on Facebook. And I do one per launch. So it&#8217;s just us in there. It&#8217;s not an ongoing from prior. It&#8217;s just us. All the information is in there. We sing happy, you know, it&#8217;s happy birthday when it&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s birthday. And people can put whatever they want to put in there. But that&#8217;s the cleanest way. And then I use email and stuff as well, because Facebook warps, you know, graphics. But yeah, it&#8217;s a Facebook room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Awesome. We have a question, a creative question from Virginia. Virginia asks you, &#8220;What triggers a story for you? For example, what bites you and makes you want to tell a particular story?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a good question. My brain is really crowded. And if I didn&#8217;t write I would probably need to be institutionalized. There&#8217;s so much, and I have a folder on the computer, but it&#8217;s like the start of a kajillion different things and it&#8217;s thoughts. And so I don&#8217;t … you know, I can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s no one thing. I mean, you know, I have on-running series. I have the Hot Damn series, I have Magic and Mayhem series, I have Good to the Last Death, and I have Magical Midlife series. So I have four on-running series. So I kind of know that I&#8217;m going to hit each of those, at least in semi the kind of order. So it&#8217;s just me, I guess it&#8217;s just being back with those characters. I always reread the last book from that series before I start a new one. Because my worlds have so many different rules, I have to get back into that head and that voice. And then I just usually get excited and go okay, what&#8217;s gonna happen to them? Let&#8217;s see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. I love that. So you had mentioned earlier, sometimes you needed that change of atmosphere, change of pace. Sometimes you did the car you found is a really great place for inspiration. So I need to ask, is the actual mechanical process of writing, is it on a keyboard? Do you do notepad and pen, dictation? How do you do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t do dictation. I tried that and that was a hot mess. I write on the computer and I also handwrite. Like if something is like not working, there&#8217;s something about a really sharp, and I use Ticonderoga. It&#8217;s not a commercial for them but those are the pencils I like, really sharp, and a yellow legal pad. Okay, here&#8217;s a scary story. When I pitched, when I was an actor, I was very fortunate. I was never a household name, but I was always a working actor. I didn&#8217;t know how to type. I never took typing in high school like a dumbass. When I was in college, you could pay your, you know, suitemate five bucks to type your term papers. And that&#8217;s what I did. And so I also learned how to type. When I wrote that book, I hand wrote that 95k word book, and then I sat down and I typed it, which was probably why I got the shingles. But, um, and shingles suck. But, yes, so, yes, I type now. My kids laugh because I do not type correctly. But I&#8217;m like, you know what, you&#8217;re going to college, so shut up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a single finger typer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;m more than one finger, but I have to look at the keyboard. And so but sometimes, if it&#8217;s not happening, there&#8217;s something about holding a pencil. And there&#8217;s something about a connection to paper that will sometimes break something for me, break through something for me. And so that makes sense. So those are the two ways that I write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome, awesome, thank you so much. So Lexi&#8217;s asking a question about the Universes. So, &#8220;With multiple writers creating in your universe, are there ways that they can specifically interact with or not interact with together to affect the greater universe as a whole?&#8221; Like, I guess the rules?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you can&#8217;t kill my characters. They see that right up front. You can&#8217;t kill my characters. Um, you know, what a lot of people, some of the people that have been extremely successful, I would say, with sales, because I think you&#8217;re successful if you write a book, quite honestly. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to do. They have mixed their own series characters that are already popular with their people, and brought them in, and mixed them up with mine. And then for a lot of those people, it&#8217;s turned into a running little series within the series. Yeah, I have a rule you don&#8217;t kill my characters. And that has been fine. I mean, don&#8217;t go make anybody pregnant or this or that or anything. And a lot of people too, there&#8217;s a character, Zelda is the main heroine. She actually started as a very selfish, you know, magic abusing, in a funny way, witch, and then she&#8217;s got her friend Sassy, who has been working on learning to speak Canadian for a couple of books. She&#8217;s working on the languages of the world. Yeah, Canadian and British she&#8217;s having trouble with. But there are a couple characters that, she has three cats: Fat Bastard, Jango Fett, and Boba Fett, who were cats of mine, who I immortalized in this book. They&#8217;re no longer here, but they &#8220;yous guys,&#8221; they talk like this. And they lick the bowls. And they, you know, they&#8217;re, so those guys get used in a lot of people&#8217;s books. And then there&#8217;s the head witch Baba Yaga, who dresses from, you know, Madonna era, cone bras and rubber bracelets. And she&#8217;s a hoot. So those are kind of my characters that tend to get dropped into other people&#8217;s stories. Or they&#8217;ll use Ass Jacket, West Virginia, and something will go on there. So yeah, the only rule I have is you can&#8217;t kill my characters. And then the second part of that question, how these women are communicating with each other, is in the Facebook group. And a lot of them, actually a lot of people that write in my universe are actually good friends of mine, who are just amazing authors. And then some of the newer people, newer friends that I have, have been recommendations from other people, or they&#8217;ve approached me themselves, with a really, usually hilarious pitch. That&#8217;s like, I really want to write and here&#8217;s why. But then I look at them in the genre that they write. Because if somebody writes, you know, horror, and has a following that way, that doesn&#8217;t really fit. You know, there are a couple rules, it&#8217;s not erotica. I don&#8217;t erotica is great. You know, that&#8217;s, but that&#8217;s not what the series is. They need to read my series and make sure they connect to it, and can write enough fun. It doesn&#8217;t have to match my stuff. But it has to be a fun, comedic, paranormal. Happily ever after at the end. Like, another rule, there&#8217;s no menage in this, in these particular series. Menage books are great. It&#8217;s not what the Magic and Mayhem that I write is about. So those are some of the rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome, thank you. So we have less than a minute left. But I did want to pop this up from Ace Adams who asks, &#8220;Do you ever feel overwhelmed and wonder which project to pull out of the pile to work on?&#8221; And I guess maybe the question there is, do you ever feel overwhelmed and how do you deal with that? Like, how do you, what do you pull out first?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I do feel overwhelmed and the first thing that I pull out is laundry, and the second thing … No, um, yeah, but like I said, I&#8217;m really lucky to get to do what I do and to be able to do it. Being overwhelmed is nothing new. It&#8217;s in my personality anyway. And then I will just make my lists and check stuff off. If I don&#8217;t get to everything, I don&#8217;t get to everything. I&#8217;ll get to it to the next day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Well, Robyn, you know what? Oh my god, that felt like two minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did, that went really fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that was a such a fantastic conversation. Thank you so much for such an entertaining time that we got to spend this afternoon and answering questions from folks. I guess, where can people find out more about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robyn Peterman&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can go to robynpeterman.com. They can go to magicandmayhemuniverse.com. I&#8217;m on Facebook. I&#8217;m on Instagram, but I&#8217;m not. I had to pick my social media. So Facebook is probably the best. There&#8217;s an author page, a personal page. There you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Lefebvre&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awesome. Thanks so much, Robyn.

Yeah, so it says we&#8217;re live and I&#8217;m gonna just trust that we are. So thank you for tuning in to Self-Publishing Insiders with Draft2Digital. And toay I got a really special guest because this happens to be, I know I say this about practically every guest, Honorée, but I mean it when I say it about you, one of my favorite people on the planet. Honorée Corder, welcome to the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, we have been friends for a decade, Kevin Tumlinson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, when you think about it, we were recently at the Career Author Summit near Nashville. Which happens to be your hometown, that area that we were in. I don&#8217;t want to give any secrets away, but you live in the area. And yeah, that was something that came up, right? Like, here we were in a group, a big room full of authors who were essentially where you and I were, when we first met. It was a bizarre feeling to be the speakers at an event for a group like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. I think we&#8217;re the OGs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the OGs, that&#8217;s how I describe us too. Yeah, we go all the way back. So, you and I met at, and you&#8217;re gonna have to help me remember the name of the, it wasn&#8217;t yet called the …&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Columnists&#8217; Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Columnists&#8217; Summit. That&#8217;s what it was. Which became the Smarter Artists Summit. Before, you know, this was the self-publishing podcast, guys. There were like 25 of us in that room. There was me, you, several others. But Damon Courtney was also in that room. And that room, that day, was the birthplace of BookFunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, BookFunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we really have been tapped into the foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use BookFunnel every day. Thank you, Damon Courtney. Every single day. And everyone who I interact with who&#8217;s an author, I&#8217;m like, do you have BookFunnel? And they&#8217;re like, what&#8217;s BookFunnel? Like, oh, I&#8217;m gonna change your life today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, how have you not heard of this yet? Because I mean, I for one talk about it all the time. We&#8217;ve had Damon on the show multiple times. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, probably, the person I work most with is the professional who is writing their first book. So they&#8217;re not indie author folks like we are. They&#8217;re not writer folks like we are. They&#8217;re professionals who then say, I need to have a book, and then they take my course. And so then I introduce them to BookFunnel. But they&#8217;re not living in the author world. So they don&#8217;t know what a KDP dashboard is. I have to explain keywords and categories and HTML code and all that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s good, though. What I&#8217;m seeing more and more, and we&#8217;re gonna jump into our topic, I promise everyone, but what I&#8217;m seeing more and more is people who normally would have gone the traditional route are discovering some, we&#8217;ll just say perks, to going the self-publishing route. But they, unlike us, like we when we came into this, we sort of, I mean, I had a traditional contract at one point. I think you did too, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, no. So I started indie publishing in &#8217;04.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. 2004. Well, that&#8217;s before me then. I thought I was an old timer in this business. But yeah, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8217;04 was my first book. And then &#8217;09, and then off to the races</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;ve been self-publishing the whole time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole time. Well, because you were legit. I didn&#8217;t fancy myself a writer or an author and didn&#8217;t call myself an author until seven books. So my psychology needed some work, honestly. It never occurred to me to get an agent. And because writers were people that went to college and took writing courses and were journalists and went to journalism school. or went to, like, gosh, I&#8217;m not even thinking of it. But like, where do you go if you want to become an actor? Like, there are a couple of universities, like one in New York and one in LA, that&#8217;s where you go if you want to do that. I didn&#8217;t do any of those things. So I thought, well, I&#8217;ll just stay down here in loser land where you indie publish, and just … But I didn&#8217;t realize, but that&#8217;s what I was thinking Kevin. But I didn&#8217;t realize that I had made money. Like, I had sold 11,000 copies of my first book in &#8217;05, like physical copies before Kindle. I didn&#8217;t realize that there was a whole thing. It wasn&#8217;t until I was at that conference, and I met you and those 23 other people that I realized that it&#8217;s a whole thing and they&#8217;re my people. There are book people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>04:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. Was that kind of when you finally said &#8220;I&#8217;m an author,&#8221; is when you found out that …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>04:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think so yeah, I think about that time. I had this … By the time it was 2011, I had&nbsp;<em>Tall Order</em>, the Successful Single Mom book series. So I had, you know, 8 or 10 books, and it was book 7 when I was at a networking event, and someone asked me what I did. And I said, I&#8217;m a business and executive coach and a speaker, motivational speaker, corporate trainer. And the person I was with said, and she&#8217;s an author. And the person we were talking to was like, you&#8217;re an author? You&#8217;ve written a book? That&#8217;s really cool. And when we left, she was like, way to bury the lede. Because being an author is that cool thing that everybody wants to hear about. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve written a book? I&#8217;ve always wanted to write a book, talk to me about writing a book.&#8221; But I was just being every person. Oh, everybody&#8217;s a coach and a speaker, right? I hadn&#8217;t connected the dots quite yet. So 2011, going to that conference, discovering the Self-Publishing Podcast guys, meeting you, meeting some people that I&#8217;m still really good friends with, like you, to this day a decade later, that was really a turning point for me in learning about things like BookFunnel, and that kind of stuff. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, and I think there&#8217;s a lot of lessons to unpack from that brief introduction there. Because one, I yanked my headphones out of my ear. Don&#8217;t do that, by the way. That&#8217;s an uncomfortable thing to do. Especially because I wanna hear you. You went to that, what was at that time a fairly small conference. I wouldn&#8217;t even consider that a conference, frankly. I mean, it was ..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I was, here&#8217;s what I think it was, because there was something before that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there was like something similar to it one year before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, something similar to it, which was world building. So how I had discovered the Self-Publishing Podcast guys was, I had a mastermind that I was in, and one of the guys in the mastermind called me and he said, there&#8217;s somebody like you, it&#8217;s a guy, his name is Steve Scott. And Steve Scott, then I went and listened to, because podcasts again, podcasts are still new to a lot of people in &#8217;21. But in &#8217;11, podcasts were like, what&#8217;s a podcast? And so I went and searched for all the podcasts he&#8217;d been on. And he had been talking to the SPP guys. And then I started listening to their podcast. And this was in &#8217;10, I think, I think this was in &#8217;10. Because in 2010, I started listening to their podcast, and they started talking about their event that they were having. And I wrote to them, and I said, I only write nonfiction. I think this is a fiction conference. But can I crash? I&#8217;ll pay. Can I come play with the other writers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>07:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was sort of right at their pivot point when they were, because that summit was really initially all about writing in the world they were creating, right? And I didn&#8217;t have any interest in doing that. And I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t either. I don&#8217;t think anybody who was there had an interest in that actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s interesting, because I got the impression that that&#8217;s what they were having it for. But I just wanted to come be around other writers. And it was in Austin, which is where I was living. And I just, there&#8217;s so few people, when you work for yourself, that you can talk to you about what you&#8217;re doing and learn from. And I was hungry for community. I was so hungry for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same. And I had been doing the Wordslinger podcast for a while at that point, and a lot of the people who were there recognized me from the show. And so that was interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are cool and&nbsp;famous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was not yet, it was sort of locally famous, in my opinion. Like, you know, if you were part of the indie author community, like that specific group, you may have heard of it. So to meet people who had listened to the show and knew my voice was interesting. I had no idea how far it would go from there. I mean, it was, it really took a corner after that. But yeah, so that was, so to me that the lesson there is, those little events where you get to meet and connect with authors. They&#8217;re worth going to. You need to find the crowd that&#8217;s at your level and that is like you, thinks like you. Not necessarily exactly like you, but the same goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well aspirational, right? Aspirational folks, and then the folks that are at your level, and then folks you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Okay, so yeah, I think is a good segue into our topic, which is, because one of the things you talk about a lot, and I&#8217;ve interviewed you several times actually, on Wordslinger podcast. You talked about this on my show, you talked about this at the Career Author Summit, but sort of the money mindset. And I think that&#8217;s a very important thing, because the first thing everyone&#8217;s going to want to know is how do I make more money? But I think our relationship to money is equally important. Before we get into it though, I have to post this comment. It was the first thing that came up. Gil Jackson on YouTube says, &#8220;Writing is like sex. First you do it for love, then you do it for your friends, and then you do it for money. From Virginia Woolf.&#8221; So Gil, thanks for the quote. And with that said, let&#8217;s talk money.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shouldn&#8217;t it be &#8220;with your friends&#8221;? Wait, never mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you do it with your friends or for your friends?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your friends, for your friends, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virginia Woolf, though. I mean, I did a whole senior seminar on her in college. So it may have been with her friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, is it before, is that the exhibitionist? Like, we could go down a whole rabbithole not appropriate for TV, but …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is before. Yeah, we&#8217;ll do the. we&#8217;ll stop at the NSFW. So, money mindset. Now you wrote, so I was privileged after meeting you … Oops, sorry. I brought the quote back up. After meeting you at that little summit, I was first privileged to be a part of your Prosperity for Writers Group that you did, which resulted in a book that I am, I believe I&#8217;ve got a couple of quotes in. And then you were kind enough to do the foreword for my book,&nbsp;<em>30 Day Author</em>. And that whole thing is about,&nbsp;<em>30 Day Author</em>&nbsp;not so much, but your book&nbsp;<em>Prosperity for Writers</em>, and that program that you did, is all about changing your mindset toward money. Do you, I don&#8217;t want to step on the lede or anything here, but like, what is your kind of philosophy when it comes to money?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my philosophy about money is that money is energy. My thought about money is that money is energy. And that the more you respect money, the less you&#8217;re afraid of money. The more you understand it, the better you treat it, the more you will have. And so if you have reservations around or resistance around it, then it&#8217;s not going to come to you. And if it does, it&#8217;s not going to stay with you. And it&#8217;s going to be a cause of constant stress and aggravation, and all those sorts of things. But there&#8217;s, but money is not a person. People get mad at money. Like, I got a bill or I don&#8217;t have enough money or whatever. They get mad at people who have money or they resent people that have money and all of that just kind of shows up in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. I think they say that&#8217;s like the number one fight that married couples have is over money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the number one cause of divorce is not infidelity. It&#8217;s money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. So it&#8217;s a very personal thing. Yeah. I actually have known couples that split up over the money, but stayed together through the infidelity, so that&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s weird. Fun facts in Kevin&#8217;s life. Not me. Kara and I are good all around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s delightful. It was so nice to see her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and that was the first time you guys had met. She really liked you a lot. I couldn&#8217;t get her to shut up about you, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, well, that&#8217;s good. If it&#8217;s good, then that&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So okay, I like what you said that money is energy. Bizarrely, this is how things work, Honorée. You and I both know this. Bizarrely this morning, as I was getting ready, I always try to watch something inspirational. And one of the videos that popped up, and I can&#8217;t remember the guy&#8217;s name, of course. But it was like his top 10 rules about life or whatever. And number one was that money was energy. So that&#8217;s a bizarre coincidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I just think people get tripped up over it. And it&#8217;s almost everyone. Almost everyone finds themselves at a ceiling or a floor or a plateau or whatever. Or they, there&#8217;s a lot of comparison-it is, right? It&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s the saying, never tell anyone how much money you make. Some people will think it&#8217;s too much, and other people will think it&#8217;s not enough. And so like, that&#8217;s just something that we don&#8217;t talk about. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s, I&#8217;m a lady of a certain age. So you never talk about your age or your weight or your income. Although that&#8217;s changed. The kids today now post it on social media, which is interesting to me. Not my preference, but hey, whatever makes you happy. I think when people can come to a peace with money, then they will have more abundance. And also to make more money as a writer, which I think is part of at least what we want to talk about today. And you just watched me talk about it for, I don&#8217;t know, 45 minutes, an hour, or whatever it was. The first thing is, you have to believe that it&#8217;s possible for you. You have to like, look at somebody else and go, if that person can make a living as a writer … If I want to make a living as a writer, there are things that I need to do, actual things I need to do. Right? But the first thing, before you even do those things, is to think, is it possible that maybe I could make a living as a writer? Okay, it&#8217;s possible. Do I believe it&#8217;s possible? Okay, I believe I could make money as a writer. And then go and look for—BOLO, be on the lookout for—people that are making money as writers, and there are more and more all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>15:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that comes right back to, and I didn&#8217;t mean to cut you off. Go ahead. That comes right back to what we were discussing earlier about going out and meeting authors who are kind of at your level and above, you know? Because that&#8217;s how, I love that Jim Rohn philosophy of, you&#8217;re the average … is it Jim Rohn or Zig Ziglar who said, you&#8217;re the average of the five people you spend the most time with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either one. Jim or Zig, either one, they&#8217;re both good. Either one of them. I think it&#8217;s Jim Rohn. I think you&#8217;re right. Yes, you are the average of the five people, or your income is the average of the five people you spend the most time with. And so choose your intimate circle wisely. Because people who are achieving and making more are going to inspire you to make more. Not because there&#8217;s comparison-it is. Just because, like attracts like. Water seeks its own level, birds of a feather, I could go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I had a whole conversation when I was at NINC with an author talking about how I wanted to upgrade my five, right? Because, you know, I mean, I make money, but I want to make a different level of money. And she&#8217;s like, well, and she asked a question that I think is very pertinent, which was, well, what are you doing to be someone worthy of their five? And I think part of that starts with kind of your attitude towards money and not, you&#8217;re not just joining in on this to upgrade yourself, but you want to find a way to add to their value and wealth, and everything. So sorry, I kind of took that off on my own there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that. I think that is so valuable, that is so valuable. Because if you&#8217;re coming just to take, that&#8217;s energy. And if you&#8217;re coming to give, that&#8217;s energy, right? So yes, if I want to hang out with the JD Barkers, right? Or the Stephanie Bonds, right, the folks at the conference, people who are successful have a place to be, right? Every minute is already spoken for. And they have goals and they have plans. And so to take their eye off of that, to give you their time and attention, that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s not something to do lightly. So you&#8217;ve got to have something valuable that causes them to say, I&#8217;m going to not do this other thing that was already planned. And I&#8217;m going to talk to you. But I had two really valuable conversations with each of those people at that conference, life-changing conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>18:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yeah, exactly. Same here. Yeah. And now since we invoked his name, Zig Ziglar, he has that quote that says, you can have everything you want in life if you&#8217;re willing to help enough other people get what they want. So I think that that&#8217;s a key to, you know, money, to wealth, in whatever form you describe it, because wealth and money are not always synonymous. Money certainly helps with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>18:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correct. And also too there&#8217;s something, there is a principle about money. And I&#8217;m constantly reading, so I could not tell you which book I read it in. But there was something in a book that I read not very long ago, so recently, in the last year. And the book said, once you have mastered money, once you have accumulated wealth and knowledge, you will lose it if you don&#8217;t share it. So you are commanded. And I believe the word was commanded. You are commanded to turn around and pay it forward. In other words, you can&#8217;t just hoard it. Because that&#8217;s an issue, right? Like if you hoard money, or you get rid of money, like there&#8217;s all the things, right? So if you have any of those behaviors, it&#8217;s just a place for you to have healing. But then once you figure it out, then you have to pay it forward. Which is, I guess, I wrote&nbsp;<em>Prosperity for Writers</em>&nbsp;years ago, but that that was my feeling at that conference. Because half the room was like, we&#8217;re making money as writers. And the other half was like, we don&#8217;t make any money as writers, but we really want to. And I think it&#8217;s just this, it&#8217;s just your psychology. You just have to believe you can. Now, you have to still write to make a living as a writer. There is that pesky little daily habit you have to have, writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>20:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s like that whole, writing that story about, or it&#8217;s a joke I think, about how the guy was like stranded in the ocean about to drown and he kept crying out to God to help save me, save me. And a ship comes by and says, you need aboard? And he says, no. God&#8217;s gonna save me. Helicopter comes and yeah, yeah. God&#8217;s like, well, I sent a helicopter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>20:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, God&#8217;s like, I sent a boat and a helicopter. What else can I do for you? Yes, so you have to still, you have to still, once you believe you can, then you have to do the actions. You have to write, publish, you have to write, you have to publish, you have to market. You got to make friends with your peers. You have to have a good bench. Because I have lots of friends who have regular traditional jobs. They don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know what they think I do. I think they think I sit on my front porch all day and watch the deer eat, right? Which is a good portion of my day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is interesting, what people think you&#8217;re up to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Well, I love those writer memes, right? It&#8217;s like what I do, what people think I do. It&#8217;s like, write autographs, and go to movie premieres, and things like that. But you really have to do, I&#8217;m</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt. I was putting this up because I&#8217;m about to ask you this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I just started reading, but you do have to do all of the things in order to be a full-time writer. And it sounds very sexy, like the signing of the books, and you know, all of those things. But there are a lot of hours of alone time where you are just working, where you are just creating, you are just editing, you are proofing, you are marketing, you are thinking, and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody likes to hear that stuff. So I wanted to pop up this question, and I did not mean to interrupt your flow. So Gil says, &#8220;Hi Honorée,&#8221; first of all. &#8220;The cost of setting up a writing career is prohibitive to all but the well-heeled.&#8221; So this isn&#8217;t a question, it&#8217;s a comment,. But &#8220;one of those costs that could be lower is the closed market for buying ISBNs, both in the UK and US.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know that I understand, I don&#8217;t know that I agree with the first sentence. And I don&#8217;t know what the second sentence means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think what he&#8217;s referring to is the fact that, in both the UK and the US, you have to purchase your ISBNs, rather than like in Canada, where you&#8217;re given one by default when you produce a work. So I kind of see where that&#8217;s coming from. So I think that that cost is kind of nominal for most people, but it can be expensive. I mean, you know, hundreds of dollars sometimes. And if you&#8217;re buying a lot of ISBNs, you know, I got 50 books. So if I had to buy $100 ISBNs for each book, that&#8217;s quite a bit of money,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they&#8217;re not. I get my ISBNs in a block of 100 for $1,000. So it&#8217;s $10 an ISBN. I don&#8217;t recommend using free ISBNs, I do recommend buying them. But, so a writing business is not unlike any other business. If you wanted to have an ice cream business, you wouldn&#8217;t complain that you had to buy ice cream or an ice cream maker. Or you had to have a counter or a cash register or ice cream cups or scoops or paper or anything like that. So being a full-time writer means you&#8217;re in business and you have to do the things that businesspeople do, you have to set up a business. And a lot of people, myself included, funded my writing business from another business, and had to do it a lesson at a time and an expense at a time. And it was a while before it was profitable. But I had to, you know, make sacrifices and save and do that sort of thing. Alternatively, you can get a small business loan or something like that. I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s only for the well-heeled. As a matter of fact, I know a lot of people who have bootstrapped it, where they paid for low-cost covers, and they did, you know, cleaned a house to get an editor. You know, cleaned houses to save up money to buy editing services. And so it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s doable, it just requires a mindset shift. I think people think because it&#8217;s writing, it should be free? I&#8217;m not sure. Or that it shouldn&#8217;t cost anything. But it&#8217;s a business. If you want to make money from a business, you have to put money into a business,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Or something. Money and time are the two costs of business, and they&#8217;re going to have a sort of inverse relationships sometimes. But you you&#8217;re gonna put one or the other in, and you have to decide which one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Or both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both, yeah. So Varden on Facebook says, &#8220;Money gives me anxiety.&#8221; And they laughed about this, but that&#8217;s a common thing that happens with authors. Money does kind of tend to give us anxiety. But maybe it&#8217;s not money itself. We all want money. It&#8217;s everything to do with money, you know. What do you do to earn it? What do you got to do to keep it? What should you do with it when you have it? What would you say to someone like Varden about that anxiety?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that&#8217;s just is an opportunity for healing. So thank you for posting that. Because you&#8217;re not the only one, you&#8217;re just the one who had the courage to post that. So thank you for that. And I would empower you to read and learn about money, both the energetic side, the metaphysical side, right, the energetic side, and also the practical side. So most people who know me, I will say, like, I&#8217;m one part woo-woo, and one part practical, and I meet in the middle. As you pray, move your feet, right? And so I have learned to be very respectful of money. So I have an allocation strategy for before I get money, which keeps me out of trouble. So I know that I don&#8217;t ever want to get caught where my accountant is like, it&#8217;s time for the check, mwahahaha, right? And I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not prepared. And so I started a practice years ago, where I save. I give, first of all, I&#8217;m a tither, if you&#8217;re someone who is a tither, you&#8217;ll know what that is. Or you can just be a giver. So the challenge with any situation is congestion. And the antidote is always circulation. So there&#8217;s a whole lot I can say about that. But it&#8217;s like, if you want more money, then you got to put it into circulation, you have to put something into circulation. So the first thing I do when I receive money is to give money. And then I take some and I put it away, right? And then I learned this from Tony Robbins, he&#8217;s like, if you&#8217;re not going to give or save $10 out of $100, you&#8217;re not going to save $100,000 out of a million. So get in the practice of putting some money away. Because when you have a reserve of money, when you have access to money, there is something very calming about, oh, in the event of an emergency, I have $1,000. This is what financial people will say is, have $1,000 in an account in case you need a tire, or your dog needs a vet visit, or something like that. Okay, so this is very practical, basic stuff. But when you do it, you start to feel better. The anxiety goes down. So if the anxiety&#8217;s from not having a reserve, then start to work on having a reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if it&#8217;s just starting with a very small amount.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correct. Always have a little bit of cash in your house, always have a little bit of cash in the bank, right? So give and save, and then save for taxes. Because if you&#8217;re in your author business, you&#8217;re 1099 and you&#8217;re gonna have to pay taxes at some point. So put that money away, right when you get it. So don&#8217;t go, I got $1,000. Go, well, Uncle Sam&#8217;s gonna want $250 bucks, so I&#8217;m going to put $250 bucks away. And then I have $750 bucks. So then you have, like, then you can spend what you have. And there&#8217;s something very empowering, trust me on this. There&#8217;s something very empowering about having a reserve of money, that if you need it, it&#8217;s there. And you can have access to it right away. And then learn about taking that reserve and growing it, and then growing it massively. So some people grow it massively by investing in real estate, some people invest in the stock market, some people just keep it in the bank account at, you know, 2% interest or whatever the savings rate is. It doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s that you want to have a reserve. And if you have debt, get that paid off as soon as you can. But just have a practice for, oh, I&#8217;m going to get money. And when I get money, this is what I&#8217;m going to do with it. Not oh, the money&#8217;s here. Let&#8217;s see what happens. All bets are off. Because I don&#8217;t know about y&#8217;all, but I get 100 emails a day from places I can spend money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe me. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon, J Crew, LL Bean, right? They&#8217;re lined up every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leroy had a response to Varden that I definitely want to read for the record here. He says that, &#8220;Look at money as a resource and look at where your resources being drained. Look for ways to combine things that will reduce your expenditures and add where you want to pour your resource.&#8221; So I think that&#8217;s excellent advice. So thank you for that, Leroy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leroy, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s such a touchy subject, and it&#8217;s weird that it is. Well, I guess it&#8217;s not weird that it is. It&#8217;s very personal. And your relationship with money comes with certain anxieties. I love, what&#8217;s the guy, I can never remember the name of the guy who wrote Rich Dad, Poor Dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Kiyosaki.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. And his whole philosophy is that we just, we&#8217;ve kind of been set up to fail in some ways when it comes to money, because our attitudes to our money come from our education. Our education didn&#8217;t bother teaching us about money. Other than, you know, sort of large-scale economy stuff. I know for a fact that I never got an accounting lesson, I never got anything in grade school or high school when it came to money. And so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And having a business means you need to know how to how to read a P&amp;L, how to make more than what you spend, or at least plan for that. Like, know where you&#8217;re, because we&#8217;re entrepreneurs as authors, right? Sometimes book sales are going to be more or less. Income is going to come from different places. I have a time of the year that I tend to make much more money than other times of the year, because of the different pieces of my business and projects that I&#8217;m doing. And I just know that, so I&#8217;m not doing the same thing in this part of the year that I&#8217;m doing in this part of the year, just because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is excellent, because … well go ahead and finish your thought. But you got me excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, thank you. Because I know the rhythms, right? I know the rhythms of things. And I also am analytical in a way that, when I have noticed that, like, I like to take off time in the summer. But being an entrepreneur means that I&#8217;m the engine of my business. And so if I take time off, then the income takes time off too. And so I&#8217;ve started to figure out, like, how can I set things up so that it&#8217;s more consistent? So that it&#8217;s not like, some times of the year high and some times of the year are low, so making a lot of money, but also making it more consistently is important, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, yep. And the reason I got excited about that is because that&#8217;s, that gels with, the idea of seasons, like just because something works in January doesn&#8217;t mean it will work in October. And so you need to be prepared and know yourself, know the ebb and flow of your income and your business so that you can prepare for those fallow days. So see, Ace had a question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;ve always loved the name Ace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ace Adams too, man. That is an excellent name. Coming in from YouTube, &#8220;I&#8217;ve begun to realize I&#8217;m more of a gambler than a sound business / money manager. Even with my writing business, I&#8217;ve tended to fly by the seat of my pants and hoping for the best. How do I change?&#8221; First of all, that&#8217;s the right question to ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. You have a great name and a great question Ace, thank you. So realization is the first piece right? Like, oh, I realize that I do this. I have this habit, I have this pattern. Hmm. What would be more effective? I don&#8217;t live in the world, Kevin&#8217;s known me obviously a long time. And I don&#8217;t live in the world of good or bad, right or wrong. I always look at things like, is it effective versus ineffective? Right? And if what I&#8217;m doing is not effective, how can I be more effective, because I am averse to pain and suffering. So I tend to analyze things and to do kind of a post mortem of everything and go, well what was working that I was doing? What worked when I was successful? And then what wasn&#8217;t working as well, what wasn&#8217;t working as well? So what do I need to keep doing? What do I need to stop doing? What do I need to start doing? Those are all questions you can loop in. And so then is it with your writing business that you&#8217;re like, oh, I write when I&#8217;m inspired? Or is it that I have a writing practice? Is it that I&#8217;m releasing, and when I release a book, then I make income, but then I don&#8217;t feel as urgent to write because I&#8217;ve released a book and so I need to work on that. So I&#8217;d be curious to know which part of flying by the seat of the pants you&#8217;re talking about. But I do want to commend you on something that most people would go, well, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s commended for? But I am. Because I think hoping for the best is actually a terrific idea. Because a lot of people don&#8217;t have hope. And I don&#8217;t believe hope is a strategy. Right? I think you actually have to have a plan and a strategy and execute the plan. But if you&#8217;re not at least expecting the best, you&#8217;re not going to get anything but the worst. Most people are like, well, you know, I hope the worst doesn&#8217;t happen. Oh, wait, the worst happened. Well you planted the seed that the worst was going to happen. So it&#8217;s no surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>34:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah, that&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s sort of, the metaphor for that I think is very appropriate is the idea of, I remember watching, I think it may have been Tim Allen, or it may have been Tim Ferriss. I don&#8217;t know. But they were talking about how they were taking a sort of a training on how to drive a racecar. And one of the pieces of advice, or what was drilled into them before they ever got behind the wheel, was that you are going to go in the direction that your eyes go. So that is as true of the racetrack as it is of life. You&#8217;re going to go in exactly the direction you&#8217;re looking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re going to find what you&#8217;re looking for. Right? So in&nbsp;<em>Prosperity for Writers</em>&nbsp;I talk about BOLO, which is the term I learned from watching hundreds of episodes of Law and Order. Which is a police term, right? They&#8217;ll say be on the lookout, BOLO, for the suspect. And so you&#8217;ve got to BOLO for people who are making a living as a writer. Because if you BOLO for people that are starving artists, guess what? You&#8217;re gonna find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. BOLO for dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, but also for nuggets of information, or a piece of inspiration that can help you. I like that you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m watching something to inspire myself in the morning. Like, that&#8217;s a really good time to do that. Watch something that inspires you any time you need to be inspired, which, some days it&#8217;s more than others kids. Right? Sometimes I need inspiration more than I need food. Especially when you get to that ugly middle part of writing a book, or marketing, or you&#8217;re not as successful as you want to be. There are so many different times where it&#8217;s tempting to give up, and so you&#8217;ve got to be on the lookout for things that are going to keep you going when you want to quit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, exactly. This one comes with a book recommendation from Hannah, Hannah Steenbock from Germany. Hello, Germany. So Hannah says, &#8220;And I love the book&nbsp;<em>Profit First</em>. It teaches how to allocate money and offers a system to make it easy.&#8221; That&#8217;s Mike Michalowicz. Is that how you pronounce his name? Michalowicz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, Mike Michalowicz. He wrote&nbsp;<em>The Pumpking Plan&nbsp;</em>and he&#8217;s got another book coming out. His stuff is really sound, and from reading his books, he comes from a place of experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m dropping a link to that in the comments if it&#8217;ll go through. It&#8217;s spinning. So there it goes, it should pop through. So if you&#8217;re interested in that, that&#8217;s on Amazon. No affiliate link or anything there. Feel free to search for the title anywhere you prefer your books to come from. If I could have created a Books2Read link on the fly, I would of. Oh, feature request, everyone at Draft2Digital. So that&#8217;s an excellent book. Um, so yeah, I want to scroll down and see if we got some other questions here. Ace has another comment. &#8220;I spent lots of money on Amazon / BookBub ads and really did not understand the platforms. So I was throwing money out there and hoping for the best, like playing slot machines.&#8221; That&#8217;s a common thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>38:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So common, so common Ace. And no judgement, I did the same thing, and then learned it, and then they changed it. And by the way, playing the slots is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>38:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we should say, sometimes there&#8217;s an element of gambling to this. My definition of marketing is that marketing is improving the odds that the right reader will discover your book at the moment they&#8217;re ready to buy it. And so there is an element of luck, if you want to call it that, involved. But what do they call it? They say luck is preparation meets opportunity. So you know, you gamble, but you gamble from a place of, I&#8217;ve researched this, I know this about it. And Ace, don&#8217;t feel bad about that. Okay, you threw some money away, but you learned something from it, too. So now you&#8217;ve got that experience to build on. So now you can go find resources, and YouTube is full of people telling you how to use BookBub ads, by the way, so you don&#8217;t even have to pay for anything to learn about this. You can go learn all about BookBub ads. You can also go on our blog. I&#8217;ll find the link to that, or if Elyssa is listening, I think she could probably find the link. We just posted a post about how to increase your odds of getting a BookBub featured deal. So go find that on the D2D blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BookBub is a kingmaker. I got my first BookBub on my first try on the first day, and everyone hated me, but that was back in the day right, when it was super new. And now I have to apply all the time like everybody else. But it&#8217;s a really great, they&#8217;ve done a really good job. The BookBub people have done a really terrific job of putting together a resource for authors. And, but and also too, I love what you said about marketing. And I know that the number one way people find out about a book is from a recommendation. Do not underestimate, said another way, take heart in the fact that when you write a really good book, then connecting with your readers on Goodreads, going and doing a book reading at your local library, like connecting with people one on one is also a really good way to market your books. Like it seems like, I&#8217;m just gonna do ads, it&#8217;s very disconnected. But ultimately, I&#8217;ve always just been a boots on the ground person. I&#8217;m just always carrying a book around and people are like, what are you doing? I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m an author. Here&#8217;s my book. Here&#8217;s one of my books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well I mean, you know, and I&#8217;ve run into authors who, they hate the idea of handing out free books like that, right? Because they&#8217;re expensive. And I&#8217;m like, well okay, think about what you&#8217;re saying, because there is an investment that has to be made in promoting yourself, right? You could use BookFunnel, yes, and give your ebooks away for free, and there&#8217;s very little overhead to that. I think it&#8217;s like 20 bucks a month for BookFunnel. I don&#8217;t even remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s $150 a year for BookFunnel integrated to your email list. I mean, legitimately, it is the cheapest, most effective strategy, and you can put it in an email signature. I mean, so money tools, on your website, all the things. I mean Damon has just done, I&#8217;m a huge fan. He&#8217;s just done an incredible job of creating a tool that&#8217;s reasonably priced for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elyssa has posted a, she went and did what I wish I could have done on there. She went and posted a link, books2read.com/profitfirst, which will take you to Mike&#8217;s book. Thank you Elyssa. She also did go find the link for that blog post. It&#8217;s called the Top 10 Tips to Get a BookBub Featured Deal. So if you go, if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no thumbs up option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, we need that. She&#8217;s a superstar. if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast instead of watching, you can go to draft2digital.com/blog and just search for, you could probably type in like 10 tips and BookBub and probably find that right away. So go find that. Some excellent tips by the way, and that&#8217;s from one of our contributing writers. So um, I&#8217;m just scanning through comments here. Okay, looks like we&#8217;ve caught up on questions and comments. If you have another question, by the way, listeners, viewers, go ahead and ask us whatever you want. We got like three more minutes. So I want to make sure we address any comments that come in. But what&#8217;s interesting Honorée is, so Kara and I were kind of comparing notes. That conference, by the way, the Career Author Summit, put on by J. Thorne and Zach, what&#8217;s his last name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohannon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohannan, thank you. I think I mispronounce his name every time. I probably mispronounced it when I was talking directly to him at that conference. But that was her first conference, she&#8217;d never been to an author conference before. So I&#8217;m like, wow, this is going to be challenging for you from now on, because that kind of sets the bar kind of high for …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You never forget your first author conference or the cool people that you meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You really don&#8217;t. I have yet to meet anybody who went to an author conference, especially one around that size, because for various reasons that one was only about, there were 35 people in that room at any given time. And so that&#8217;s a smaller one, it&#8217;s normally much bigger than that. But that&#8217;s a sort of smallish conference, all told. But I think that&#8217;s probably the perfect size to aim for, for your first author conference. Because it&#8217;s not overwhelming. You don&#8217;t get lost in the crowd. You get to talk to everybody. And I think that one of the biggest benefits of that first conference where I met you was, that was by far not my first author conference, but you know, the size of that one meant I got to meet everybody, got to know everybody. I think we were all in a Slack channel together at one point. But you know, because of that I met you, and you&#8217;ve been such a wonderful part of my life and author career. I just want you to know how much I appreciate you for everything you do, not just for me, but for the whole author community. I think people benefit greatly just by your presence in the world. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well thank you. I did a lot of work on my money mindset, on my prosperity consciousness, on my writing, on my beliefs, all of those things. And so when I see someone who is struggling with that, I just want to help them, right? I think that&#8217;s what happens when anyone does something, when you turn around and go, gosh, how can I help somebody to avoid the pain and suffering and get all the pleasure and the wins and the rewards? So thank you for that, Kevin, and thank you for being my friend for a decade. And here&#8217;s to another decade of book writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s to 100 decades more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, many more decades, of course.

Yeah, so it says we&#8217;re live and I&#8217;m gonna just trust that we are. So thank you for tuning in to Self-Publishing Insiders with Draft2Digital. And toay I got a really special guest because this happens to be, I know I say this about practically every guest, Honorée, but I mean it when I say it about you, one of my favorite people on the planet. Honorée Corder, welcome to the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, we have been friends for a decade, Kevin Tumlinson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>00:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, when you think about it, we were recently at the Career Author Summit near Nashville. Which happens to be your hometown, that area that we were in. I don&#8217;t want to give any secrets away, but you live in the area. And yeah, that was something that came up, right? Like, here we were in a group, a big room full of authors who were essentially where you and I were, when we first met. It was a bizarre feeling to be the speakers at an event for a group like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. I think we&#8217;re the OGs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the OGs, that&#8217;s how I describe us too. Yeah, we go all the way back. So, you and I met at, and you&#8217;re gonna have to help me remember the name of the, it wasn&#8217;t yet called the …&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Columnists&#8217; Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Columnists&#8217; Summit. That&#8217;s what it was. Which became the Smarter Artists Summit. Before, you know, this was the self-publishing podcast, guys. There were like 25 of us in that room. There was me, you, several others. But Damon Courtney was also in that room. And that room, that day, was the birthplace of BookFunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, BookFunnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we really have been tapped into the foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>01:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use BookFunnel every day. Thank you, Damon Courtney. Every single day. And everyone who I interact with who&#8217;s an author, I&#8217;m like, do you have BookFunnel? And they&#8217;re like, what&#8217;s BookFunnel? Like, oh, I&#8217;m gonna change your life today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, how have you not heard of this yet? Because I mean, I for one talk about it all the time. We&#8217;ve had Damon on the show multiple times. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, probably, the person I work most with is the professional who is writing their first book. So they&#8217;re not indie author folks like we are. They&#8217;re not writer folks like we are. They&#8217;re professionals who then say, I need to have a book, and then they take my course. And so then I introduce them to BookFunnel. But they&#8217;re not living in the author world. So they don&#8217;t know what a KDP dashboard is. I have to explain keywords and categories and HTML code and all that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s good, though. What I&#8217;m seeing more and more, and we&#8217;re gonna jump into our topic, I promise everyone, but what I&#8217;m seeing more and more is people who normally would have gone the traditional route are discovering some, we&#8217;ll just say perks, to going the self-publishing route. But they, unlike us, like we when we came into this, we sort of, I mean, I had a traditional contract at one point. I think you did too, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, no. So I started indie publishing in &#8217;04.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:18</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. 2004. Well, that&#8217;s before me then. I thought I was an old timer in this business. But yeah, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8217;04 was my first book. And then &#8217;09, and then off to the races</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;ve been self-publishing the whole time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>03:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole time. Well, because you were legit. I didn&#8217;t fancy myself a writer or an author and didn&#8217;t call myself an author until seven books. So my psychology needed some work, honestly. It never occurred to me to get an agent. And because writers were people that went to college and took writing courses and were journalists and went to journalism school. or went to, like, gosh, I&#8217;m not even thinking of it. But like, where do you go if you want to become an actor? Like, there are a couple of universities, like one in New York and one in LA, that&#8217;s where you go if you want to do that. I didn&#8217;t do any of those things. So I thought, well, I&#8217;ll just stay down here in loser land where you indie publish, and just … But I didn&#8217;t realize, but that&#8217;s what I was thinking Kevin. But I didn&#8217;t realize that I had made money. Like, I had sold 11,000 copies of my first book in &#8217;05, like physical copies before Kindle. I didn&#8217;t realize that there was a whole thing. It wasn&#8217;t until I was at that conference, and I met you and those 23 other people that I realized that it&#8217;s a whole thing and they&#8217;re my people. There are book people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>04:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. Was that kind of when you finally said &#8220;I&#8217;m an author,&#8221; is when you found out that …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>04:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think so yeah, I think about that time. I had this … By the time it was 2011, I had&nbsp;<em>Tall Order</em>, the Successful Single Mom book series. So I had, you know, 8 or 10 books, and it was book 7 when I was at a networking event, and someone asked me what I did. And I said, I&#8217;m a business and executive coach and a speaker, motivational speaker, corporate trainer. And the person I was with said, and she&#8217;s an author. And the person we were talking to was like, you&#8217;re an author? You&#8217;ve written a book? That&#8217;s really cool. And when we left, she was like, way to bury the lede. Because being an author is that cool thing that everybody wants to hear about. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve written a book? I&#8217;ve always wanted to write a book, talk to me about writing a book.&#8221; But I was just being every person. Oh, everybody&#8217;s a coach and a speaker, right? I hadn&#8217;t connected the dots quite yet. So 2011, going to that conference, discovering the Self-Publishing Podcast guys, meeting you, meeting some people that I&#8217;m still really good friends with, like you, to this day a decade later, that was really a turning point for me in learning about things like BookFunnel, and that kind of stuff. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, and I think there&#8217;s a lot of lessons to unpack from that brief introduction there. Because one, I yanked my headphones out of my ear. Don&#8217;t do that, by the way. That&#8217;s an uncomfortable thing to do. Especially because I wanna hear you. You went to that, what was at that time a fairly small conference. I wouldn&#8217;t even consider that a conference, frankly. I mean, it was ..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I was, here&#8217;s what I think it was, because there was something before that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there was like something similar to it one year before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>06:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, something similar to it, which was world building. So how I had discovered the Self-Publishing Podcast guys was, I had a mastermind that I was in, and one of the guys in the mastermind called me and he said, there&#8217;s somebody like you, it&#8217;s a guy, his name is Steve Scott. And Steve Scott, then I went and listened to, because podcasts again, podcasts are still new to a lot of people in &#8217;21. But in &#8217;11, podcasts were like, what&#8217;s a podcast? And so I went and searched for all the podcasts he&#8217;d been on. And he had been talking to the SPP guys. And then I started listening to their podcast. And this was in &#8217;10, I think, I think this was in &#8217;10. Because in 2010, I started listening to their podcast, and they started talking about their event that they were having. And I wrote to them, and I said, I only write nonfiction. I think this is a fiction conference. But can I crash? I&#8217;ll pay. Can I come play with the other writers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>07:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was sort of right at their pivot point when they were, because that summit was really initially all about writing in the world they were creating, right? And I didn&#8217;t have any interest in doing that. And I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t either. I don&#8217;t think anybody who was there had an interest in that actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s interesting, because I got the impression that that&#8217;s what they were having it for. But I just wanted to come be around other writers. And it was in Austin, which is where I was living. And I just, there&#8217;s so few people, when you work for yourself, that you can talk to you about what you&#8217;re doing and learn from. And I was hungry for community. I was so hungry for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same. And I had been doing the Wordslinger podcast for a while at that point, and a lot of the people who were there recognized me from the show. And so that was interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are cool and&nbsp;famous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>08:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was not yet, it was sort of locally famous, in my opinion. Like, you know, if you were part of the indie author community, like that specific group, you may have heard of it. So to meet people who had listened to the show and knew my voice was interesting. I had no idea how far it would go from there. I mean, it was, it really took a corner after that. But yeah, so that was, so to me that the lesson there is, those little events where you get to meet and connect with authors. They&#8217;re worth going to. You need to find the crowd that&#8217;s at your level and that is like you, thinks like you. Not necessarily exactly like you, but the same goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well aspirational, right? Aspirational folks, and then the folks that are at your level, and then folks you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>09:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Okay, so yeah, I think is a good segue into our topic, which is, because one of the things you talk about a lot, and I&#8217;ve interviewed you several times actually, on Wordslinger podcast. You talked about this on my show, you talked about this at the Career Author Summit, but sort of the money mindset. And I think that&#8217;s a very important thing, because the first thing everyone&#8217;s going to want to know is how do I make more money? But I think our relationship to money is equally important. Before we get into it though, I have to post this comment. It was the first thing that came up. Gil Jackson on YouTube says, &#8220;Writing is like sex. First you do it for love, then you do it for your friends, and then you do it for money. From Virginia Woolf.&#8221; So Gil, thanks for the quote. And with that said, let&#8217;s talk money.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shouldn&#8217;t it be &#8220;with your friends&#8221;? Wait, never mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you do it with your friends or for your friends?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With your friends, for your friends, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virginia Woolf, though. I mean, I did a whole senior seminar on her in college. So it may have been with her friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, is it before, is that the exhibitionist? Like, we could go down a whole rabbithole not appropriate for TV, but …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is before. Yeah, we&#8217;ll do the. we&#8217;ll stop at the NSFW. So, money mindset. Now you wrote, so I was privileged after meeting you … Oops, sorry. I brought the quote back up. After meeting you at that little summit, I was first privileged to be a part of your Prosperity for Writers Group that you did, which resulted in a book that I am, I believe I&#8217;ve got a couple of quotes in. And then you were kind enough to do the foreword for my book,&nbsp;<em>30 Day Author</em>. And that whole thing is about,&nbsp;<em>30 Day Author</em>&nbsp;not so much, but your book&nbsp;<em>Prosperity for Writers</em>, and that program that you did, is all about changing your mindset toward money. Do you, I don&#8217;t want to step on the lede or anything here, but like, what is your kind of philosophy when it comes to money?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>11:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my philosophy about money is that money is energy. My thought about money is that money is energy. And that the more you respect money, the less you&#8217;re afraid of money. The more you understand it, the better you treat it, the more you will have. And so if you have reservations around or resistance around it, then it&#8217;s not going to come to you. And if it does, it&#8217;s not going to stay with you. And it&#8217;s going to be a cause of constant stress and aggravation, and all those sorts of things. But there&#8217;s, but money is not a person. People get mad at money. Like, I got a bill or I don&#8217;t have enough money or whatever. They get mad at people who have money or they resent people that have money and all of that just kind of shows up in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. I think they say that&#8217;s like the number one fight that married couples have is over money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the number one cause of divorce is not infidelity. It&#8217;s money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>12:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. So it&#8217;s a very personal thing. Yeah. I actually have known couples that split up over the money, but stayed together through the infidelity, so that&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s weird. Fun facts in Kevin&#8217;s life. Not me. Kara and I are good all around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s delightful. It was so nice to see her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and that was the first time you guys had met. She really liked you a lot. I couldn&#8217;t get her to shut up about you, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, well, that&#8217;s good. If it&#8217;s good, then that&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:16</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So okay, I like what you said that money is energy. Bizarrely, this is how things work, Honorée. You and I both know this. Bizarrely this morning, as I was getting ready, I always try to watch something inspirational. And one of the videos that popped up, and I can&#8217;t remember the guy&#8217;s name, of course. But it was like his top 10 rules about life or whatever. And number one was that money was energy. So that&#8217;s a bizarre coincidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>13:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I just think people get tripped up over it. And it&#8217;s almost everyone. Almost everyone finds themselves at a ceiling or a floor or a plateau or whatever. Or they, there&#8217;s a lot of comparison-it is, right? It&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s the saying, never tell anyone how much money you make. Some people will think it&#8217;s too much, and other people will think it&#8217;s not enough. And so like, that&#8217;s just something that we don&#8217;t talk about. It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s, I&#8217;m a lady of a certain age. So you never talk about your age or your weight or your income. Although that&#8217;s changed. The kids today now post it on social media, which is interesting to me. Not my preference, but hey, whatever makes you happy. I think when people can come to a peace with money, then they will have more abundance. And also to make more money as a writer, which I think is part of at least what we want to talk about today. And you just watched me talk about it for, I don&#8217;t know, 45 minutes, an hour, or whatever it was. The first thing is, you have to believe that it&#8217;s possible for you. You have to like, look at somebody else and go, if that person can make a living as a writer … If I want to make a living as a writer, there are things that I need to do, actual things I need to do. Right? But the first thing, before you even do those things, is to think, is it possible that maybe I could make a living as a writer? Okay, it&#8217;s possible. Do I believe it&#8217;s possible? Okay, I believe I could make money as a writer. And then go and look for—BOLO, be on the lookout for—people that are making money as writers, and there are more and more all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>15:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that comes right back to, and I didn&#8217;t mean to cut you off. Go ahead. That comes right back to what we were discussing earlier about going out and meeting authors who are kind of at your level and above, you know? Because that&#8217;s how, I love that Jim Rohn philosophy of, you&#8217;re the average … is it Jim Rohn or Zig Ziglar who said, you&#8217;re the average of the five people you spend the most time with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:02</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either one. Jim or Zig, either one, they&#8217;re both good. Either one of them. I think it&#8217;s Jim Rohn. I think you&#8217;re right. Yes, you are the average of the five people, or your income is the average of the five people you spend the most time with. And so choose your intimate circle wisely. Because people who are achieving and making more are going to inspire you to make more. Not because there&#8217;s comparison-it is. Just because, like attracts like. Water seeks its own level, birds of a feather, I could go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I had a whole conversation when I was at NINC with an author talking about how I wanted to upgrade my five, right? Because, you know, I mean, I make money, but I want to make a different level of money. And she&#8217;s like, well, and she asked a question that I think is very pertinent, which was, well, what are you doing to be someone worthy of their five? And I think part of that starts with kind of your attitude towards money and not, you&#8217;re not just joining in on this to upgrade yourself, but you want to find a way to add to their value and wealth, and everything. So sorry, I kind of took that off on my own there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>17:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that. I think that is so valuable, that is so valuable. Because if you&#8217;re coming just to take, that&#8217;s energy. And if you&#8217;re coming to give, that&#8217;s energy, right? So yes, if I want to hang out with the JD Barkers, right? Or the Stephanie Bonds, right, the folks at the conference, people who are successful have a place to be, right? Every minute is already spoken for. And they have goals and they have plans. And so to take their eye off of that, to give you their time and attention, that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s not something to do lightly. So you&#8217;ve got to have something valuable that causes them to say, I&#8217;m going to not do this other thing that was already planned. And I&#8217;m going to talk to you. But I had two really valuable conversations with each of those people at that conference, life-changing conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>18:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yeah, exactly. Same here. Yeah. And now since we invoked his name, Zig Ziglar, he has that quote that says, you can have everything you want in life if you&#8217;re willing to help enough other people get what they want. So I think that that&#8217;s a key to, you know, money, to wealth, in whatever form you describe it, because wealth and money are not always synonymous. Money certainly helps with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>18:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correct. And also too there&#8217;s something, there is a principle about money. And I&#8217;m constantly reading, so I could not tell you which book I read it in. But there was something in a book that I read not very long ago, so recently, in the last year. And the book said, once you have mastered money, once you have accumulated wealth and knowledge, you will lose it if you don&#8217;t share it. So you are commanded. And I believe the word was commanded. You are commanded to turn around and pay it forward. In other words, you can&#8217;t just hoard it. Because that&#8217;s an issue, right? Like if you hoard money, or you get rid of money, like there&#8217;s all the things, right? So if you have any of those behaviors, it&#8217;s just a place for you to have healing. But then once you figure it out, then you have to pay it forward. Which is, I guess, I wrote&nbsp;<em>Prosperity for Writers</em>&nbsp;years ago, but that that was my feeling at that conference. Because half the room was like, we&#8217;re making money as writers. And the other half was like, we don&#8217;t make any money as writers, but we really want to. And I think it&#8217;s just this, it&#8217;s just your psychology. You just have to believe you can. Now, you have to still write to make a living as a writer. There is that pesky little daily habit you have to have, writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>20:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s like that whole, writing that story about, or it&#8217;s a joke I think, about how the guy was like stranded in the ocean about to drown and he kept crying out to God to help save me, save me. And a ship comes by and says, you need aboard? And he says, no. God&#8217;s gonna save me. Helicopter comes and yeah, yeah. God&#8217;s like, well, I sent a helicopter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>20:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, God&#8217;s like, I sent a boat and a helicopter. What else can I do for you? Yes, so you have to still, you have to still, once you believe you can, then you have to do the actions. You have to write, publish, you have to write, you have to publish, you have to market. You got to make friends with your peers. You have to have a good bench. Because I have lots of friends who have regular traditional jobs. They don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know what they think I do. I think they think I sit on my front porch all day and watch the deer eat, right? Which is a good portion of my day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is interesting, what people think you&#8217;re up to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Well, I love those writer memes, right? It&#8217;s like what I do, what people think I do. It&#8217;s like, write autographs, and go to movie premieres, and things like that. But you really have to do, I&#8217;m</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt. I was putting this up because I&#8217;m about to ask you this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I just started reading, but you do have to do all of the things in order to be a full-time writer. And it sounds very sexy, like the signing of the books, and you know, all of those things. But there are a lot of hours of alone time where you are just working, where you are just creating, you are just editing, you are proofing, you are marketing, you are thinking, and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>21:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody likes to hear that stuff. So I wanted to pop up this question, and I did not mean to interrupt your flow. So Gil says, &#8220;Hi Honorée,&#8221; first of all. &#8220;The cost of setting up a writing career is prohibitive to all but the well-heeled.&#8221; So this isn&#8217;t a question, it&#8217;s a comment,. But &#8220;one of those costs that could be lower is the closed market for buying ISBNs, both in the UK and US.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know that I understand, I don&#8217;t know that I agree with the first sentence. And I don&#8217;t know what the second sentence means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think what he&#8217;s referring to is the fact that, in both the UK and the US, you have to purchase your ISBNs, rather than like in Canada, where you&#8217;re given one by default when you produce a work. So I kind of see where that&#8217;s coming from. So I think that that cost is kind of nominal for most people, but it can be expensive. I mean, you know, hundreds of dollars sometimes. And if you&#8217;re buying a lot of ISBNs, you know, I got 50 books. So if I had to buy $100 ISBNs for each book, that&#8217;s quite a bit of money,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>22:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they&#8217;re not. I get my ISBNs in a block of 100 for $1,000. So it&#8217;s $10 an ISBN. I don&#8217;t recommend using free ISBNs, I do recommend buying them. But, so a writing business is not unlike any other business. If you wanted to have an ice cream business, you wouldn&#8217;t complain that you had to buy ice cream or an ice cream maker. Or you had to have a counter or a cash register or ice cream cups or scoops or paper or anything like that. So being a full-time writer means you&#8217;re in business and you have to do the things that businesspeople do, you have to set up a business. And a lot of people, myself included, funded my writing business from another business, and had to do it a lesson at a time and an expense at a time. And it was a while before it was profitable. But I had to, you know, make sacrifices and save and do that sort of thing. Alternatively, you can get a small business loan or something like that. I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s only for the well-heeled. As a matter of fact, I know a lot of people who have bootstrapped it, where they paid for low-cost covers, and they did, you know, cleaned a house to get an editor. You know, cleaned houses to save up money to buy editing services. And so it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s doable, it just requires a mindset shift. I think people think because it&#8217;s writing, it should be free? I&#8217;m not sure. Or that it shouldn&#8217;t cost anything. But it&#8217;s a business. If you want to make money from a business, you have to put money into a business,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Or something. Money and time are the two costs of business, and they&#8217;re going to have a sort of inverse relationships sometimes. But you you&#8217;re gonna put one or the other in, and you have to decide which one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Or both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>24:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both, yeah. So Varden on Facebook says, &#8220;Money gives me anxiety.&#8221; And they laughed about this, but that&#8217;s a common thing that happens with authors. Money does kind of tend to give us anxiety. But maybe it&#8217;s not money itself. We all want money. It&#8217;s everything to do with money, you know. What do you do to earn it? What do you got to do to keep it? What should you do with it when you have it? What would you say to someone like Varden about that anxiety?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>25:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that&#8217;s just is an opportunity for healing. So thank you for posting that. Because you&#8217;re not the only one, you&#8217;re just the one who had the courage to post that. So thank you for that. And I would empower you to read and learn about money, both the energetic side, the metaphysical side, right, the energetic side, and also the practical side. So most people who know me, I will say, like, I&#8217;m one part woo-woo, and one part practical, and I meet in the middle. As you pray, move your feet, right? And so I have learned to be very respectful of money. So I have an allocation strategy for before I get money, which keeps me out of trouble. So I know that I don&#8217;t ever want to get caught where my accountant is like, it&#8217;s time for the check, mwahahaha, right? And I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m not prepared. And so I started a practice years ago, where I save. I give, first of all, I&#8217;m a tither, if you&#8217;re someone who is a tither, you&#8217;ll know what that is. Or you can just be a giver. So the challenge with any situation is congestion. And the antidote is always circulation. So there&#8217;s a whole lot I can say about that. But it&#8217;s like, if you want more money, then you got to put it into circulation, you have to put something into circulation. So the first thing I do when I receive money is to give money. And then I take some and I put it away, right? And then I learned this from Tony Robbins, he&#8217;s like, if you&#8217;re not going to give or save $10 out of $100, you&#8217;re not going to save $100,000 out of a million. So get in the practice of putting some money away. Because when you have a reserve of money, when you have access to money, there is something very calming about, oh, in the event of an emergency, I have $1,000. This is what financial people will say is, have $1,000 in an account in case you need a tire, or your dog needs a vet visit, or something like that. Okay, so this is very practical, basic stuff. But when you do it, you start to feel better. The anxiety goes down. So if the anxiety&#8217;s from not having a reserve, then start to work on having a reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if it&#8217;s just starting with a very small amount.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>27:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correct. Always have a little bit of cash in your house, always have a little bit of cash in the bank, right? So give and save, and then save for taxes. Because if you&#8217;re in your author business, you&#8217;re 1099 and you&#8217;re gonna have to pay taxes at some point. So put that money away, right when you get it. So don&#8217;t go, I got $1,000. Go, well, Uncle Sam&#8217;s gonna want $250 bucks, so I&#8217;m going to put $250 bucks away. And then I have $750 bucks. So then you have, like, then you can spend what you have. And there&#8217;s something very empowering, trust me on this. There&#8217;s something very empowering about having a reserve of money, that if you need it, it&#8217;s there. And you can have access to it right away. And then learn about taking that reserve and growing it, and then growing it massively. So some people grow it massively by investing in real estate, some people invest in the stock market, some people just keep it in the bank account at, you know, 2% interest or whatever the savings rate is. It doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s that you want to have a reserve. And if you have debt, get that paid off as soon as you can. But just have a practice for, oh, I&#8217;m going to get money. And when I get money, this is what I&#8217;m going to do with it. Not oh, the money&#8217;s here. Let&#8217;s see what happens. All bets are off. Because I don&#8217;t know about y&#8217;all, but I get 100 emails a day from places I can spend money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe me. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon, J Crew, LL Bean, right? They&#8217;re lined up every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leroy had a response to Varden that I definitely want to read for the record here. He says that, &#8220;Look at money as a resource and look at where your resources being drained. Look for ways to combine things that will reduce your expenditures and add where you want to pour your resource.&#8221; So I think that&#8217;s excellent advice. So thank you for that, Leroy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leroy, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>29:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s such a touchy subject, and it&#8217;s weird that it is. Well, I guess it&#8217;s not weird that it is. It&#8217;s very personal. And your relationship with money comes with certain anxieties. I love, what&#8217;s the guy, I can never remember the name of the guy who wrote Rich Dad, Poor Dad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Kiyosaki.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. And his whole philosophy is that we just, we&#8217;ve kind of been set up to fail in some ways when it comes to money, because our attitudes to our money come from our education. Our education didn&#8217;t bother teaching us about money. Other than, you know, sort of large-scale economy stuff. I know for a fact that I never got an accounting lesson, I never got anything in grade school or high school when it came to money. And so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>30:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And having a business means you need to know how to how to read a P&amp;L, how to make more than what you spend, or at least plan for that. Like, know where you&#8217;re, because we&#8217;re entrepreneurs as authors, right? Sometimes book sales are going to be more or less. Income is going to come from different places. I have a time of the year that I tend to make much more money than other times of the year, because of the different pieces of my business and projects that I&#8217;m doing. And I just know that, so I&#8217;m not doing the same thing in this part of the year that I&#8217;m doing in this part of the year, just because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:13</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is excellent, because … well go ahead and finish your thought. But you got me excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>31:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, thank you. Because I know the rhythms, right? I know the rhythms of things. And I also am analytical in a way that, when I have noticed that, like, I like to take off time in the summer. But being an entrepreneur means that I&#8217;m the engine of my business. And so if I take time off, then the income takes time off too. And so I&#8217;ve started to figure out, like, how can I set things up so that it&#8217;s more consistent? So that it&#8217;s not like, some times of the year high and some times of the year are low, so making a lot of money, but also making it more consistently is important, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, yep. And the reason I got excited about that is because that&#8217;s, that gels with, the idea of seasons, like just because something works in January doesn&#8217;t mean it will work in October. And so you need to be prepared and know yourself, know the ebb and flow of your income and your business so that you can prepare for those fallow days. So see, Ace had a question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;ve always loved the name Ace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ace Adams too, man. That is an excellent name. Coming in from YouTube, &#8220;I&#8217;ve begun to realize I&#8217;m more of a gambler than a sound business / money manager. Even with my writing business, I&#8217;ve tended to fly by the seat of my pants and hoping for the best. How do I change?&#8221; First of all, that&#8217;s the right question to ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>32:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. You have a great name and a great question Ace, thank you. So realization is the first piece right? Like, oh, I realize that I do this. I have this habit, I have this pattern. Hmm. What would be more effective? I don&#8217;t live in the world, Kevin&#8217;s known me obviously a long time. And I don&#8217;t live in the world of good or bad, right or wrong. I always look at things like, is it effective versus ineffective? Right? And if what I&#8217;m doing is not effective, how can I be more effective, because I am averse to pain and suffering. So I tend to analyze things and to do kind of a post mortem of everything and go, well what was working that I was doing? What worked when I was successful? And then what wasn&#8217;t working as well, what wasn&#8217;t working as well? So what do I need to keep doing? What do I need to stop doing? What do I need to start doing? Those are all questions you can loop in. And so then is it with your writing business that you&#8217;re like, oh, I write when I&#8217;m inspired? Or is it that I have a writing practice? Is it that I&#8217;m releasing, and when I release a book, then I make income, but then I don&#8217;t feel as urgent to write because I&#8217;ve released a book and so I need to work on that. So I&#8217;d be curious to know which part of flying by the seat of the pants you&#8217;re talking about. But I do want to commend you on something that most people would go, well, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s commended for? But I am. Because I think hoping for the best is actually a terrific idea. Because a lot of people don&#8217;t have hope. And I don&#8217;t believe hope is a strategy. Right? I think you actually have to have a plan and a strategy and execute the plan. But if you&#8217;re not at least expecting the best, you&#8217;re not going to get anything but the worst. Most people are like, well, you know, I hope the worst doesn&#8217;t happen. Oh, wait, the worst happened. Well you planted the seed that the worst was going to happen. So it&#8217;s no surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>34:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah, that&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s sort of, the metaphor for that I think is very appropriate is the idea of, I remember watching, I think it may have been Tim Allen, or it may have been Tim Ferriss. I don&#8217;t know. But they were talking about how they were taking a sort of a training on how to drive a racecar. And one of the pieces of advice, or what was drilled into them before they ever got behind the wheel, was that you are going to go in the direction that your eyes go. So that is as true of the racetrack as it is of life. You&#8217;re going to go in exactly the direction you&#8217;re looking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>35:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re going to find what you&#8217;re looking for. Right? So in&nbsp;<em>Prosperity for Writers</em>&nbsp;I talk about BOLO, which is the term I learned from watching hundreds of episodes of Law and Order. Which is a police term, right? They&#8217;ll say be on the lookout, BOLO, for the suspect. And so you&#8217;ve got to BOLO for people who are making a living as a writer. Because if you BOLO for people that are starving artists, guess what? You&#8217;re gonna find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. BOLO for dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, but also for nuggets of information, or a piece of inspiration that can help you. I like that you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m watching something to inspire myself in the morning. Like, that&#8217;s a really good time to do that. Watch something that inspires you any time you need to be inspired, which, some days it&#8217;s more than others kids. Right? Sometimes I need inspiration more than I need food. Especially when you get to that ugly middle part of writing a book, or marketing, or you&#8217;re not as successful as you want to be. There are so many different times where it&#8217;s tempting to give up, and so you&#8217;ve got to be on the lookout for things that are going to keep you going when you want to quit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>36:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, exactly. This one comes with a book recommendation from Hannah, Hannah Steenbock from Germany. Hello, Germany. So Hannah says, &#8220;And I love the book&nbsp;<em>Profit First</em>. It teaches how to allocate money and offers a system to make it easy.&#8221; That&#8217;s Mike Michalowicz. Is that how you pronounce his name? Michalowicz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, Mike Michalowicz. He wrote&nbsp;<em>The Pumpking Plan&nbsp;</em>and he&#8217;s got another book coming out. His stuff is really sound, and from reading his books, he comes from a place of experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>37:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m dropping a link to that in the comments if it&#8217;ll go through. It&#8217;s spinning. So there it goes, it should pop through. So if you&#8217;re interested in that, that&#8217;s on Amazon. No affiliate link or anything there. Feel free to search for the title anywhere you prefer your books to come from. If I could have created a Books2Read link on the fly, I would of. Oh, feature request, everyone at Draft2Digital. So that&#8217;s an excellent book. Um, so yeah, I want to scroll down and see if we got some other questions here. Ace has another comment. &#8220;I spent lots of money on Amazon / BookBub ads and really did not understand the platforms. So I was throwing money out there and hoping for the best, like playing slot machines.&#8221; That&#8217;s a common thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>38:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So common, so common Ace. And no judgement, I did the same thing, and then learned it, and then they changed it. And by the way, playing the slots is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>38:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we should say, sometimes there&#8217;s an element of gambling to this. My definition of marketing is that marketing is improving the odds that the right reader will discover your book at the moment they&#8217;re ready to buy it. And so there is an element of luck, if you want to call it that, involved. But what do they call it? They say luck is preparation meets opportunity. So you know, you gamble, but you gamble from a place of, I&#8217;ve researched this, I know this about it. And Ace, don&#8217;t feel bad about that. Okay, you threw some money away, but you learned something from it, too. So now you&#8217;ve got that experience to build on. So now you can go find resources, and YouTube is full of people telling you how to use BookBub ads, by the way, so you don&#8217;t even have to pay for anything to learn about this. You can go learn all about BookBub ads. You can also go on our blog. I&#8217;ll find the link to that, or if Elyssa is listening, I think she could probably find the link. We just posted a post about how to increase your odds of getting a BookBub featured deal. So go find that on the D2D blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>39:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BookBub is a kingmaker. I got my first BookBub on my first try on the first day, and everyone hated me, but that was back in the day right, when it was super new. And now I have to apply all the time like everybody else. But it&#8217;s a really great, they&#8217;ve done a really good job. The BookBub people have done a really terrific job of putting together a resource for authors. And, but and also too, I love what you said about marketing. And I know that the number one way people find out about a book is from a recommendation. Do not underestimate, said another way, take heart in the fact that when you write a really good book, then connecting with your readers on Goodreads, going and doing a book reading at your local library, like connecting with people one on one is also a really good way to market your books. Like it seems like, I&#8217;m just gonna do ads, it&#8217;s very disconnected. But ultimately, I&#8217;ve always just been a boots on the ground person. I&#8217;m just always carrying a book around and people are like, what are you doing? I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m an author. Here&#8217;s my book. Here&#8217;s one of my books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>40:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well I mean, you know, and I&#8217;ve run into authors who, they hate the idea of handing out free books like that, right? Because they&#8217;re expensive. And I&#8217;m like, well okay, think about what you&#8217;re saying, because there is an investment that has to be made in promoting yourself, right? You could use BookFunnel, yes, and give your ebooks away for free, and there&#8217;s very little overhead to that. I think it&#8217;s like 20 bucks a month for BookFunnel. I don&#8217;t even remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s $150 a year for BookFunnel integrated to your email list. I mean, legitimately, it is the cheapest, most effective strategy, and you can put it in an email signature. I mean, so money tools, on your website, all the things. I mean Damon has just done, I&#8217;m a huge fan. He&#8217;s just done an incredible job of creating a tool that&#8217;s reasonably priced for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>41:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elyssa has posted a, she went and did what I wish I could have done on there. She went and posted a link, books2read.com/profitfirst, which will take you to Mike&#8217;s book. Thank you Elyssa. She also did go find the link for that blog post. It&#8217;s called the Top 10 Tips to Get a BookBub Featured Deal. So if you go, if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no thumbs up option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>42:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, we need that. She&#8217;s a superstar. if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast instead of watching, you can go to draft2digital.com/blog and just search for, you could probably type in like 10 tips and BookBub and probably find that right away. So go find that. Some excellent tips by the way, and that&#8217;s from one of our contributing writers. So um, I&#8217;m just scanning through comments here. Okay, looks like we&#8217;ve caught up on questions and comments. If you have another question, by the way, listeners, viewers, go ahead and ask us whatever you want. We got like three more minutes. So I want to make sure we address any comments that come in. But what&#8217;s interesting Honorée is, so Kara and I were kind of comparing notes. That conference, by the way, the Career Author Summit, put on by J. Thorne and Zach, what&#8217;s his last name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohannon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bohannan, thank you. I think I mispronounce his name every time. I probably mispronounced it when I was talking directly to him at that conference. But that was her first conference, she&#8217;d never been to an author conference before. So I&#8217;m like, wow, this is going to be challenging for you from now on, because that kind of sets the bar kind of high for …</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You never forget your first author conference or the cool people that you meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>43:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You really don&#8217;t. I have yet to meet anybody who went to an author conference, especially one around that size, because for various reasons that one was only about, there were 35 people in that room at any given time. And so that&#8217;s a smaller one, it&#8217;s normally much bigger than that. But that&#8217;s a sort of smallish conference, all told. But I think that&#8217;s probably the perfect size to aim for, for your first author conference. Because it&#8217;s not overwhelming. You don&#8217;t get lost in the crowd. You get to talk to everybody. And I think that one of the biggest benefits of that first conference where I met you was, that was by far not my first author conference, but you know, the size of that one meant I got to meet everybody, got to know everybody. I think we were all in a Slack channel together at one point. But you know, because of that I met you, and you&#8217;ve been such a wonderful part of my life and author career. I just want you to know how much I appreciate you for everything you do, not just for me, but for the whole author community. I think people benefit greatly just by your presence in the world. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>44:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well thank you. I did a lot of work on my money mindset, on my prosperity consciousness, on my writing, on my beliefs, all of those things. And so when I see someone who is struggling with that, I just want to help them, right? I think that&#8217;s what happens when anyone does something, when you turn around and go, gosh, how can I help somebody to avoid the pain and suffering and get all the pleasure and the wins and the rewards? So thank you for that, Kevin, and thank you for being my friend for a decade. And here&#8217;s to another decade of book writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s to 100 decades more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, many more decades, of course. All right. Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>45:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well I think we&#8217;re gonna have to wrap it up. We&#8217;re at the end, I don&#8217;t want to take up too much of Honorée&#8217;s very valuable time. But I want to thank everybody who tuned in, everyone who is listening to the rebroadcast of the podcast. Let&#8217;s go through the stuff here.

But the most important URL of all is go Honorée at honoreecorder.com, where you can find, you&#8217;ve got like your books and all that stuff listed there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>46:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have all the things. I&#8217;m gonna take a picture of us so I can put it on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>46:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need, yeah, we need to be promoting ourselves together more, I think. Because I&#8217;ll only benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got a good photo at the author summit. That was fun. And I posted that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good, I forgot about that. Yeah. I love the shot of you with your sunglasses and everything on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Honorée Corder&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my fiction photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kevin Tumlinson&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>47:21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. All right. But that&#8217;s the reality of you, though. That&#8217;s what makes that ironic. All right, everybody, make sure you go check out Honorée&#8217;s website. Thank you for being a part of the Self-Publishing Insiders, Honorée. Everyone else, thank you for being a part as well everyone, we send you our best and we hope for maximum money in your future self. Take care, everybody.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/money-and-writing-with-honoree-corder-ep061/\">Money and Writing With Honoree Corder // EP061</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog\">Draft2Digital | Blog</a>.</p>"},"wfw:commentrss":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/money-and-writing-with-honoree-corder-ep061/feed/"},"slash:comments":{"@":{},"#":"0"},"rss:post-id":{"@":{"xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1"},"#":"116219"},"meta":{"#ns":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"},{"xmlns:georss":"http://www.georss.org/georss"},{"xmlns:geo":"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"},{"xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1"}],"@":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"},{"xmlns:georss":"http://www.georss.org/georss"},{"xmlns:geo":"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"}],"#xml":{"version":"1.0","encoding":"UTF-8"},"#type":"rss","#version":"2.0","title":"Draft2Digital | Blog","description":"Distribute your books worldwide.

And we all began 2021 with a minimum hope that, once we came to the end of it, we’d be able to say “At least it wasn’t 2020.”</p>\n<p>As it turns out, 2021 started a little rough, and had some valleys for us to plow through, but ultimately came with some pretty good peaks as well. Far from being simply better than 2020, this year brought an increasing sense of hope. And we think that will continue to grow as we turn the calendar over to 2022.</p>\n<p>For Draft2Digital, the year 2021 came with some interesting opportunities, some of which we’re still watching unfold. But for the most part, it has been a year of structural growth, with things happening behind the scenes that have allowed us to refine and strengthen the resources we offer to authors.</p>\n<p>This year, as we look back at D2D’s accomplishments, we’ve also decided to try something new—we’re looking at some of the trends of the industry, drawing upon insights we’ve picked up because of our own unique perspective. And while we can’t share specific details about specific retailers (pesky non-disclosure agreements!), we <em>can</em> share what we’ve learned from monitoring sales by region, by genre, and more. We’ll take a look at some of the trends we’ve noticed over the past few years, and what we think this will all add up to for authors.</p>\n<p>To start, though, let’s take a look at some of the things D2D did for you, in 2021.</p>\n<h1>New2Improved in 2021</h1>\n<h2>D2D Print 2.0</h2>\n<p>For the past few years, our development team has been working to get D2D Print ready for a full release. It’s been in beta for a good, long while now. But not for lack of progress.</p>\n<p>In fact, the biggest reason D2D Print is still in beta is because we have been learning so much and implementing so many changes, based on your feedback and on some of our own insights, that until recently it just wasn’t quite ready for prime time. There are still a few screws to tighten and adjustments to make, but we’re closer to being able to pull up the blinds and turn on the sign for a full release.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of what we’ve done to make D2D Print much more D2D worthy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’ve added an additional step in the Print process (Step 5), splitting up the pricing and approval steps.</li>\n<li>Proof copies of your book will now be available for $30 flat, which includes express shipping. <em>For now, proofs will only be available for the US and Canada.</em></li>\n<li>You aren’t required to purchase a Proof Copy to approve your book for distribution, of course. And we actually recommend using our Digital Proof so your book can reach readers even faster!</li>\n<li>Once you’ve approved either a digital or a physical proof, you’ll be able to purchase Author Copies. <em>For now, Author Copies are only available in the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</em></li>\n<li>Say bye-bye to the surcharges for purchasing only 1 or 2 Author Copies! We’re pretty psyched to get rid of that annoying fee.</li>\n<li>We’ve built a better user experience—better quality and faster turnaround times for both Proof and Author Copies. Plus, we’ve improved the purchasing experience for Author and Proof copies, bringing it all in-house at D2D, so there’s no more hopping around.</li>\n<li>We’ve made it easier and faster to get books live and to troubleshoot problems when there’s an issue. <em>If</em> there’s an issue. This <em>is</em> D2D, after all—<em>we crush issues like bug.</em></li>\n<li>Due to switching print partners, there is now some overhead involved when it comes to making changes to your print book. We don’t like charging authors for things, if it can be avoided. So we’ve come up with a solution that we believe is fair: We’ve implemented a token system that gives you one free change token every 90 days, per title, and you pay only $25 for extra change tokens as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about the token system (and plenty of other related things) in our <strong>Knowledge Base</strong>. <a href=\"https://draft2digital.com/knowledge-base/#what-are-print-change-tokens-and-why-would-i-need-\">Click here to read the article.</a></p>\n<p>We’re continuing to make improvements and refine how D2D Print works, because we want you to have the same excellent experience with this service that you get from everything else we do. It’s almost ready, and we’re onboarding authors from the waiting list with greater speed. There are already 11,000 titles live through the program, and more to come!</p>\n<p>Soon every D2D Author will be able to use this print-on-demand service, but if you’d like to get on the onboarding waiting list you can do so by visiting this link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/\">https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/</a></p>\n<h2>BorrowBox</h2>\n<p>We love libraries—they’re often the first place where readers discover and connect with books and authors. In fact, most of the Draft2Digital staff (and pretty much all of the authors who work here) first came to love books by handing over a library card and carrying home a tall stack of treasures.</p>\n<p>So, it has always been important to us to do all we can to increase the reach of our authors into libraries worldwide. In fact, few other publishing aggregators offer as many library distribution solutions as D2D, and we’re not afraid to say it!</p>\n<p><strong>Our love for libraries is exactly why we&#8217;re so pleased to announce the addition of BorrowBox to our library distribution!</strong></p>\n<p>BorrowBox is an app that provides library patrons in Australia with access to an ever-growing collection of eBooks. The service is owned by Bolinda—a trusted provider of eBooks, large print books, and audiobooks for more than 20 years. These are names that Australian readers know and trust, and getting your books into these catalogs means getting tons of opportunities to connect with an enthusiastic readership!</p>\n<h2>Poetry Template</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Roses are red</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Violets are blue</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Poetry templates</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Are hard to do</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But that didn’t stop us from rolling up our sleeves and slaving over vats of hot pixels and razor-sharp code in order to give you a handy and attractive poetry template!</p>\n<p>You’ll find this template among all the others we offer for free when you get to <strong>Step 2: Inside</strong> (or Print) or <strong>Step 3: Preview</strong> (for Ebook) in our setup process. And don’t worry if you’ve already set up and published your book, you can easily go back and change the layout at any time.</p>\n<p>Getting your poetry layout to look right does require a minor bit of formatting to your Word document. But don’t worry, it’s very easy!</p>\n<p><strong>All you need to remember is that you must put two paragraph breaks between each stanza.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Here’s an example:<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" class=\"wp-image-31063 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-word.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, text, application, Word\n\nDescription automatically generated\" srcset=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-word.png 600w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-word-480x640.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" /></strong></p>\n<p>And of course, if you have questions or run into issues, you can drop a line (or a haiku, if you prefer) to our team at <a href=\"mailto:support@draft2digital.com\">support@draft2digital.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Print UBLs</h2>\n<p>With all the talk of D2D Print above, you might be asking yourself, “Self?”</p>\n<p>“Yes?”</p>\n<p>“Now that I have a print version of my book, is there anything out there that will help me <em>promote</em> the thing?”</p>\n<p>“… Ask Kevin Tumlinson.”</p>\n<p>Hey, would we let you down? Of <em>course</em> we’ve got you covered!</p>\n<p>This year, Draft2Digital made some pretty cool upgrades to our famous Universal Book Links (UBLs for short). And perhaps the biggest was the addition of support for print books!</p>\n<p>And we’re not just talking paperbacks here—you can include links to hardcover versions of your book as well.</p>\n<p>That means that you can now direct readers to <em>every</em> format of your book—from ebooks, of course, to audiobooks, and now to paperbacks and hardcovers!</p>\n<p>One thing to note: Unlike ebooks, which can be scanned and scraped and automatically added to your UBLs, the process for adding links for your print books is a little on the manual side. Similar to audiobooks, you’ll need to supply links to each of the stores where your print books can be found. But when you’re done, you’ll have one truly <em>universal</em> Universal Book Link!</p>\n<h2>Get your Priorities Straight</h2>\n<p>Speaking of UBLs, we’re thrilled to introduce a new trick to help you emphasize which retailers are “preferred,” by prioritizing storefronts on the UBL landing page!</p>\n<p>With a simple drag-and-drop from the UBL’s <strong>Link Tools</strong> page (accessed by clicking on the tile of your book from the UBL Dashboard), you can grab those two columns of dots to the left of a retailer’s logo and move it up and down in the priority list.</p>\n<p>You might use this to emphasize that you want readers to see a particular storefront first—such as your PayHip link (for direct sales), or maybe Apple or Kobo, while you’re running a promotion on one of those stores.</p>\n<p>Whatever criteria you use, now you can put your retailer of choice front and/or center, to help nudge readers in the right direction!</p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1176\" height=\"962\" class=\"wp-image-31068 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message\n\nDescription automatically generated\" srcset=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat.png 1176w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat-980x802.png 980w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat-480x393.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1176px, 100vw\" /></h2>\n<h2>Author Pages, Now Even <em>More</em> Unique!</h2>\n<p>Our Author Pages have been around for a long while, but we recently added a new feature to make them even more useful to authors—<strong>Custom URLs</strong>!</p>\n<p>Similar to how custom URLs work for some of our other tools, such as UBLs and Reading Lists, authors can now stake their claim on their author pages by adding a unique identifier. So instead of a URL that contains a bunch of numbers and letters:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://books2read.com/ap/JRwWRV\">http://books2read.com/ap/JRwWRV</a></p>\n<p>You can have an author page URL with its own unique identifier, such as your author name:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://books2read.com/kevintumlinson\">http://books2read.com/kevintumlinson</a></p>\n<p>You can actually use anything you like for your unique URL, but we recommend laying claim to your author and pen names.</p>\n<p>To set up your unique Author Page URL, just log in to your account at Books2Read.com, click on “My Account” in the menu bar, and select “Author Page Custom URLs from the menu.” Find your author page and update it with your text, and you’re good to go.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1431\" height=\"388\" class=\"wp-image-31070 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, application, website\n\nDescription automatically generated\" srcset=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de.png 1431w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de-1280x347.png 1280w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de-980x266.png 980w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de-480x130.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1431px, 100vw\" /></p>\n<h2>New Kobo Plus Territories</h2>\n<p>Kobo Plus has been a part of Draft2Digital’s retailer sphere for a couple of years now, giving you reach into the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. As of 2021, Kobo Plus now includes Australia, New Zealand, Italy, France, and Portugal!</p>\n<p>Those are great additions, and the good news is that Kobo Plus Payout Model hasn’t changed—it’s still based on the number of readers subscribing and reading books through the service. And with new territories becoming part of the service, that means lots of new readers, and lots of opportunities for your books to be discovered!</p>\n<p><strong>Here are some of the advantages of opting into Kobo Plus through Draft2Digital:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No exclusivity</strong>—While you’re enrolled in Kobo Plus, you can distribute your books to any other online bookseller that you wish! There’s no exclusivity requirement to be in the program.</li>\n<li><strong>Royalties</strong>—Royalties are based on the current Kobo Plus Payout, which increases as subscriptions rise. Your royalty share is based on a formula that takes into account the Minutes Consumed—the combined number of minutes read by paying subscribers in a given month.</li>\n<li><strong>Reach an expanding market</strong>—Now that Kobo Plus is expanding into these new markets, you’ll reach a whole new potential audience. That means more opportunities to reach more readers, and to earn more revenue!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Draft2Digital and Kobo have always had a great relationship, and we&#8217;re thrilled to offer our authors this chance to reach even further.</p>\n<h2>D2D Promotions</h2>\n<p>Helping you promote your books and find new readers is something we’re always working on. And this year, we took huge leaps in finding promotions for our authors, among our retail partners.</p>\n<p>This year, up to the first week of December&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We sent out more than 18,000 promotion opportunity email invites to authors</li>\n<li>More than 8,400 D2D author titles were submitted to retailer and library partner promotions</li>\n<li>Over 4,700 D2D author titles were included in retailer and library promotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s a lot of free promotion! And our tools for building and finding these are improving as we go. So we’re excited to see how D2D Promotions will evolve in the coming year.</p>\n<p><strong>By the way, if you’d like to register to be considered for inclusion in future promotions, you can use this form: </strong><a href=\"http://d2d.tips/d2dpromoform\"><strong>http://d2d.tips/d2dpromoform</strong></a></p>\n<h1>D2D Introspection</h1>\n<p>One of the perks of being the top distributor of books by independent authors is that we get a peak into what the industry looks like, from the inside out. This year, we want to start regularly sharing some of those insights with you.</p>\n<p>This information can be invaluable for determining industry trends, helping you make decisions about marketing and even about what genres and regions to focus on. And while we never advocate “chasing trends,” knowing what readers are gravitating to can be incredibly helpful in determining a strategy for your author business.</p>\n<p>To that end, the next couple of sections will give you <em>our</em> take on <em>your</em> industry.</p>\n<h1>Industry Insight</h1>\n<p>As many of you may know, D2D now has resources for working with our retailers to create book promotions. These are subject entirely to the vendor’s needs and plans, at the moment, but we’ve been working hard to make it easier for authors to get some of these promos. And while there are never any guarantees that a given book will be chosen, we’re very pleased at the progress and growth we’re seeing in this area.</p>\n<p>Based on data we’ve gathered from author promotions, across various retailers, over the past year, here’s what we discovered.</p>\n<h3>Top 10 Genres for 2021</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Romance</li>\n<li>Fantasy</li>\n<li>Mystery &amp; Detective</li>\n<li>Thrillers</li>\n<li>Science Fiction</li>\n<li>Erotica</li>\n<li>Women</li>\n<li>Coming of Age</li>\n<li>Sports</li>\n<li>HEALTH &amp; FITNESS / Diet &amp; Nutrition</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Within the Romance category, the top 10 sub-genres are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Romance / Contemporary</li>\n<li>Romance / Suspense</li>\n<li>Romance / Paranormal</li>\n<li>Romance / Historical</li>\n<li>Romance / General</li>\n<li>Romance / Romantic Comedy</li>\n<li>Romance / New Adult</li>\n<li>Romance / Military</li>\n<li>Romance / Action &amp; Adventure</li>\n<li>Romance / Collections &amp; Anthologies</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Regional Insights</h3>\n<p>One advantage Draft2Digital has is our ever-expanding insight into a wide range of retailers and regions, worldwide. We want to leverage that insight on your behalf, and we’re working on ways to provide our authors with a perspective on the industry that can help with marketing and selling books. Reaching a new audience is often a function of coming to understand buying trends in a given region, and so we’re looking at how those trends can be tracked and measured, and served up in a useful way.</p>\n<p>While non-disclosure agreements prevent us from sharing specifics about our retail partners, we can share select bits of data. Below is a chart displaying the percent of sales we’ve monitored for books distributed through D2D, broken down by regions, going back to 2018.</p>\n<table class=\" aligncenter\" style=\"height: 371px;\" width=\"557\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2021</td>\n<td>2020</td>\n<td>2019</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2018</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>US 55.91%<br />\nCanada 9.45%<br />\nAustralia 8.06%<br />\nGreat Britain 5.05%<br />\nGermany 4.76%<br />\nNetherlands 4.49%<br />\nFrance 2.37%<br />\nBelgium 1.28%<br />\nSwitzerland 1.04%<br />\nNew Zealand 0.92%<br />\nItaly 0.79%</td>\n<td>US 57.59%<br />\nCanada 9.12%<br />\nAustralia 7.38%<br />\nNetherlands 4.78%<br />\nGreat Britain 4.38%<br />\nGermany 4.16%<br />\nFrance 2.87%<br />\nBelgium 1.62%<br />\nSwitzerland 0.94%<br />\nItaly 0.88%</td>\n<td>US 59.70%<br />\nCanada 9.60%<br />\nAustralia 7.90%<br />\nNetherlands 4.21%<br />\nGreat Britain 4.02%<br />\nGermany 2.87%<br />\nFrance 2.69%<br />\nBelgium 1.18%<br />\nItaly 0.88%<br />\nNew Zealand 0.88%</td>\n<td>US 62.62%<br />\nCanada 9.33%<br />\nAustralia 8.37%<br />\nGreat Britain 4.20%<br />\nNetherlands 2.98%<br />\nFrance 2.81%<br />\nGermany 2.50%<br />\nItaly 1.19%<br />\nNew Zealand 0.80%<br />\nSpain 0.58%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A few key things to note: Looking at the percent change for the US, we can assume that everything outside US is considered International. This means that when we compare 2021 sales to 2020, we saw that as a percentage of overall sales, international sales grew by 2.92%.</p>\n<p>And if we look at the trend compared to 2018, that difference shows international sales having grown by 10.72% over just a four-year period.</p>\n<p>Year-over-year (YOY) sales growth from 2020 to 2021 shows:</p>\n<p>Australia up 9.21%<br />\nCanada up 3.62%<br />\nSwitzerland up 10.64%<br />\nGermany up 4.76%<br />\nGreat Britain up 15.30%</p>\n<p>This is effectively a story of how authors are using D2D to gain more sales in international markets. And with expansion into new territories (via growth by retailers such as Kobo Plus, into new regions worldwide), the opportunities for authors distributing wide continue to increase.</p>\n<p>Many of these regions, by the way, have no Amazon presence. Which means that authors distributing through KDP Select will not have an opportunity to reach these new markets.</p>\n<p>So, going forward, what sort of data would you like to see? We can’t promise that everything is on the table (again, NDAs and other restrictions do apply). But what insights might help you with making your author career more successful? Leave us a comment and let us know—we might just be able to accommodate your requests in future industry reports!</p>\n<h2>D2D Plans for Your Future</h2>\n<p>As Draft2Digital continues forward in its mission to expand author opportunities and reach, we’re establishing more relationships with both international and US retailers. That’s been a priority since our founding. And with greater reach into both retail and library markets worldwide, the inevitable outcome is greater discoverability. In some cases, we are helping authors reach markets of readers who have had very few alternatives for discovering new authors and books they love.</p>\n<p>Our roadmap for 2022 and beyond includes some pretty big shifts in opening up new markets for authors to reach, including some opportunities we think authors are going to love. The kind of thing we can’t wait to tell you about—pretty amazing stuff.</p>\n<p>As we go forward into a whole new year, it’s with an eye toward supplying you with all new tools and resources to make it much easier for you to build and grow your author career. New markets, new ways to promote, and new opportunities to grow.</p>\n<p>This year, 2021, was a year of recovery and growth. We expect that to continue, going forward, and we’re actively building new tools that are going to take you and your career to the next level. We can’t wait to see what you think of all the surprises coming your way!</p>\n<p>Until then, we want to wish you a safe, healthy, happy and prosperous new year. We’re so very honored to be a part of your author dream, and we promise we are doing everything we can to make that dream happen better and faster than you might ever have expected!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Draft2Digital Team</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/2021-the-year-of-more-author-reach/\">2021: The Year of More Author Reach</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog\">Draft2Digital | Blog</a>.</p>","summary":"<p>Every year has its ups and downs, its challenges and its victories.

Far from being simply better than 2020, this year brought an increasing sense of hope. And we think that will continue to grow as we turn the calendar over to 2022.</p>\n<p>For Draft2Digital, the year 2021 came with some interesting opportunities, some of which we’re still watching unfold. But for the most part, it has been a year of structural growth, with things happening behind the scenes that have allowed us to refine and strengthen the resources we offer to authors.</p>\n<p>This year, as we look back at D2D’s accomplishments, we’ve also decided to try something new—we’re looking at some of the trends of the industry, drawing upon insights we’ve picked up because of our own unique perspective. And while we can’t share specific details about specific retailers (pesky non-disclosure agreements!), we <em>can</em> share what we’ve learned from monitoring sales by region, by genre, and more. We’ll take a look at some of the trends we’ve noticed over the past few years, and what we think this will all add up to for authors.</p>\n<p>To start, though, let’s take a look at some of the things D2D did for you, in 2021.</p>\n<h1>New2Improved in 2021</h1>\n<h2>D2D Print 2.0</h2>\n<p>For the past few years, our development team has been working to get D2D Print ready for a full release. It’s been in beta for a good, long while now. But not for lack of progress.</p>\n<p>In fact, the biggest reason D2D Print is still in beta is because we have been learning so much and implementing so many changes, based on your feedback and on some of our own insights, that until recently it just wasn’t quite ready for prime time. There are still a few screws to tighten and adjustments to make, but we’re closer to being able to pull up the blinds and turn on the sign for a full release.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of what we’ve done to make D2D Print much more D2D worthy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We’ve added an additional step in the Print process (Step 5), splitting up the pricing and approval steps.</li>\n<li>Proof copies of your book will now be available for $30 flat, which includes express shipping. <em>For now, proofs will only be available for the US and Canada.</em></li>\n<li>You aren’t required to purchase a Proof Copy to approve your book for distribution, of course. And we actually recommend using our Digital Proof so your book can reach readers even faster!</li>\n<li>Once you’ve approved either a digital or a physical proof, you’ll be able to purchase Author Copies. <em>For now, Author Copies are only available in the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</em></li>\n<li>Say bye-bye to the surcharges for purchasing only 1 or 2 Author Copies! We’re pretty psyched to get rid of that annoying fee.</li>\n<li>We’ve built a better user experience—better quality and faster turnaround times for both Proof and Author Copies. Plus, we’ve improved the purchasing experience for Author and Proof copies, bringing it all in-house at D2D, so there’s no more hopping around.</li>\n<li>We’ve made it easier and faster to get books live and to troubleshoot problems when there’s an issue. <em>If</em> there’s an issue. This <em>is</em> D2D, after all—<em>we crush issues like bug.</em></li>\n<li>Due to switching print partners, there is now some overhead involved when it comes to making changes to your print book. We don’t like charging authors for things, if it can be avoided. So we’ve come up with a solution that we believe is fair: We’ve implemented a token system that gives you one free change token every 90 days, per title, and you pay only $25 for extra change tokens as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about the token system (and plenty of other related things) in our <strong>Knowledge Base</strong>. <a href=\"https://draft2digital.com/knowledge-base/#what-are-print-change-tokens-and-why-would-i-need-\">Click here to read the article.</a></p>\n<p>We’re continuing to make improvements and refine how D2D Print works, because we want you to have the same excellent experience with this service that you get from everything else we do. It’s almost ready, and we’re onboarding authors from the waiting list with greater speed. There are already 11,000 titles live through the program, and more to come!</p>\n<p>Soon every D2D Author will be able to use this print-on-demand service, but if you’d like to get on the onboarding waiting list you can do so by visiting this link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/\">https://draft2digital.com/printbeta/</a></p>\n<h2>BorrowBox</h2>\n<p>We love libraries—they’re often the first place where readers discover and connect with books and authors.

These are names that Australian readers know and trust, and getting your books into these catalogs means getting tons of opportunities to connect with an enthusiastic readership!</p>\n<h2>Poetry Template</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Roses are red</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Violets are blue</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Poetry templates</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Are hard to do</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But that didn’t stop us from rolling up our sleeves and slaving over vats of hot pixels and razor-sharp code in order to give you a handy and attractive poetry template!</p>\n<p>You’ll find this template among all the others we offer for free when you get to <strong>Step 2: Inside</strong> (or Print) or <strong>Step 3: Preview</strong> (for Ebook) in our setup process. And don’t worry if you’ve already set up and published your book, you can easily go back and change the layout at any time.</p>\n<p>Getting your poetry layout to look right does require a minor bit of formatting to your Word document. But don’t worry, it’s very easy!</p>\n<p><strong>All you need to remember is that you must put two paragraph breaks between each stanza.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Here’s an example:<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" class=\"wp-image-31063 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-word.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, text, application, Word\n\nDescription automatically generated\" srcset=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-word.png 600w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-word-480x640.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw\" /></strong></p>\n<p>And of course, if you have questions or run into issues, you can drop a line (or a haiku, if you prefer) to our team at <a href=\"mailto:support@draft2digital.com\">support@draft2digital.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Print UBLs</h2>\n<p>With all the talk of D2D Print above, you might be asking yourself, “Self?”</p>\n<p>“Yes?”</p>\n<p>“Now that I have a print version of my book, is there anything out there that will help me <em>promote</em> the thing?”</p>\n<p>“… Ask Kevin Tumlinson.”</p>\n<p>Hey, would we let you down? Of <em>course</em> we’ve got you covered!</p>\n<p>This year, Draft2Digital made some pretty cool upgrades to our famous Universal Book Links (UBLs for short). And perhaps the biggest was the addition of support for print books!</p>\n<p>And we’re not just talking paperbacks here—you can include links to hardcover versions of your book as well.</p>\n<p>That means that you can now direct readers to <em>every</em> format of your book—from ebooks, of course, to audiobooks, and now to paperbacks and hardcovers!</p>\n<p>One thing to note: Unlike ebooks, which can be scanned and scraped and automatically added to your UBLs, the process for adding links for your print books is a little on the manual side. Similar to audiobooks, you’ll need to supply links to each of the stores where your print books can be found. But when you’re done, you’ll have one truly <em>universal</em> Universal Book Link!</p>\n<h2>Get your Priorities Straight</h2>\n<p>Speaking of UBLs, we’re thrilled to introduce a new trick to help you emphasize which retailers are “preferred,” by prioritizing storefronts on the UBL landing page!</p>\n<p>With a simple drag-and-drop from the UBL’s <strong>Link Tools</strong> page (accessed by clicking on the tile of your book from the UBL Dashboard), you can grab those two columns of dots to the left of a retailer’s logo and move it up and down in the priority list.</p>\n<p>You might use this to emphasize that you want readers to see a particular storefront first—such as your PayHip link (for direct sales), or maybe Apple or Kobo, while you’re running a promotion on one of those stores.</p>\n<p>Whatever criteria you use, now you can put your retailer of choice front and/or center, to help nudge readers in the right direction!</p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1176\" height=\"962\" class=\"wp-image-31068 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message\n\nDescription automatically generated\" srcset=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat.png 1176w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat-980x802.png 980w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-text-application-chat-480x393.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1176px, 100vw\" /></h2>\n<h2>Author Pages, Now Even <em>More</em> Unique!</h2>\n<p>Our Author Pages have been around for a long while, but we recently added a new feature to make them even more useful to authors—<strong>Custom URLs</strong>!</p>\n<p>Similar to how custom URLs work for some of our other tools, such as UBLs and Reading Lists, authors can now stake their claim on their author pages by adding a unique identifier. So instead of a URL that contains a bunch of numbers and letters:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://books2read.com/ap/JRwWRV\">http://books2read.com/ap/JRwWRV</a></p>\n<p>You can have an author page URL with its own unique identifier, such as your author name:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://books2read.com/kevintumlinson\">http://books2read.com/kevintumlinson</a></p>\n<p>You can actually use anything you like for your unique URL, but we recommend laying claim to your author and pen names.</p>\n<p>To set up your unique Author Page URL, just log in to your account at Books2Read.com, click on “My Account” in the menu bar, and select “Author Page Custom URLs from the menu.” Find your author page and update it with your text, and you’re good to go.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1431\" height=\"388\" class=\"wp-image-31070 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de.png\" alt=\"Graphical user interface, application, website\n\nDescription automatically generated\" srcset=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de.png 1431w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de-1280x347.png 1280w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de-980x266.png 980w, https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/graphical-user-interface-application-website-de-480x130.png 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1431px, 100vw\" /></p>\n<h2>New Kobo Plus Territories</h2>\n<p>Kobo Plus has been a part of Draft2Digital’s retailer sphere for a couple of years now, giving you reach into the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. As of 2021, Kobo Plus now includes Australia, New Zealand, Italy, France, and Portugal!</p>\n<p>Those are great additions, and the good news is that Kobo Plus Payout Model hasn’t changed—it’s still based on the number of readers subscribing and reading books through the service. And with new territories becoming part of the service, that means lots of new readers, and lots of opportunities for your books to be discovered!</p>\n<p><strong>Here are some of the advantages of opting into Kobo Plus through Draft2Digital:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No exclusivity</strong>—While you’re enrolled in Kobo Plus, you can distribute your books to any other online bookseller that you wish! There’s no exclusivity requirement to be in the program.</li>\n<li><strong>Royalties</strong>—Royalties are based on the current Kobo Plus Payout, which increases as subscriptions rise. Your royalty share is based on a formula that takes into account the Minutes Consumed—the combined number of minutes read by paying subscribers in a given month.</li>\n<li><strong>Reach an expanding market</strong>—Now that Kobo Plus is expanding into these new markets, you’ll reach a whole new potential audience. That means more opportunities to reach more readers, and to earn more revenue!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Draft2Digital and Kobo have always had a great relationship, and we&#8217;re thrilled to offer our authors this chance to reach even further.</p>\n<h2>D2D Promotions</h2>\n<p>Helping you promote your books and find new readers is something we’re always working on. And this year, we took huge leaps in finding promotions for our authors, among our retail partners.</p>\n<p>This year, up to the first week of December&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We sent out more than 18,000 promotion opportunity email invites to authors</li>\n<li>More than 8,400 D2D author titles were submitted to retailer and library partner promotions</li>\n<li>Over 4,700 D2D author titles were included in retailer and library promotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s a lot of free promotion! And our tools for building and finding these are improving as we go. So we’re excited to see how D2D Promotions will evolve in the coming year.</p>\n<p><strong>By the way, if you’d like to register to be considered for inclusion in future promotions, you can use this form: </strong><a href=\"http://d2d.tips/d2dpromoform\"><strong>http://d2d.tips/d2dpromoform</strong></a></p>\n<h1>D2D Introspection</h1>\n<p>One of the perks of being the top distributor of books by independent authors is that we get a peak into what the industry looks like, from the inside out. This year, we want to start regularly sharing some of those insights with you.</p>\n<p>This information can be invaluable for determining industry trends, helping you make decisions about marketing and even about what genres and regions to focus on. And while we never advocate “chasing trends,” knowing what readers are gravitating to can be incredibly helpful in determining a strategy for your author business.</p>\n<p>To that end, the next couple of sections will give you <em>our</em> take on <em>your</em> industry.</p>\n<h1>Industry Insight</h1>\n<p>As many of you may know, D2D now has resources for working with our retailers to create book promotions. These are subject entirely to the vendor’s needs and plans, at the moment, but we’ve been working hard to make it easier for authors to get some of these promos. And while there are never any guarantees that a given book will be chosen, we’re very pleased at the progress and growth we’re seeing in this area.</p>\n<p>Based on data we’ve gathered from author promotions, across various retailers, over the past year, here’s what we discovered.</p>\n<h3>Top 10 Genres for 2021</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Romance</li>\n<li>Fantasy</li>\n<li>Mystery &amp; Detective</li>\n<li>Thrillers</li>\n<li>Science Fiction</li>\n<li>Erotica</li>\n<li>Women</li>\n<li>Coming of Age</li>\n<li>Sports</li>\n<li>HEALTH &amp; FITNESS / Diet &amp; Nutrition</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Within the Romance category, the top 10 sub-genres are:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Romance / Contemporary</li>\n<li>Romance / Suspense</li>\n<li>Romance / Paranormal</li>\n<li>Romance / Historical</li>\n<li>Romance / General</li>\n<li>Romance / Romantic Comedy</li>\n<li>Romance / New Adult</li>\n<li>Romance / Military</li>\n<li>Romance / Action &amp; Adventure</li>\n<li>Romance / Collections &amp; Anthologies</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Regional Insights</h3>\n<p>One advantage Draft2Digital has is our ever-expanding insight into a wide range of retailers and regions, worldwide. We want to leverage that insight on your behalf, and we’re working on ways to provide our authors with a perspective on the industry that can help with marketing and selling books. Reaching a new audience is often a function of coming to understand buying trends in a given region, and so we’re looking at how those trends can be tracked and measured, and served up in a useful way.</p>\n<p>While non-disclosure agreements prevent us from sharing specifics about our retail partners, we can share select bits of data. Below is a chart displaying the percent of sales we’ve monitored for books distributed through D2D, broken down by regions, going back to 2018.</p>\n<table class=\" aligncenter\" style=\"height: 371px;\" width=\"557\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>2021</td>\n<td>2020</td>\n<td>2019</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">2018</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>US 55.91%<br />\nCanada 9.45%<br />\nAustralia 8.06%<br />\nGreat Britain 5.05%<br />\nGermany 4.76%<br />\nNetherlands 4.49%<br />\nFrance 2.37%<br />\nBelgium 1.28%<br />\nSwitzerland 1.04%<br />\nNew Zealand 0.92%<br />\nItaly 0.79%</td>\n<td>US 57.59%<br />\nCanada 9.12%<br />\nAustralia 7.38%<br />\nNetherlands 4.78%<br />\nGreat Britain 4.38%<br />\nGermany 4.16%<br />\nFrance 2.87%<br />\nBelgium 1.62%<br />\nSwitzerland 0.94%<br />\nItaly 0.88%</td>\n<td>US 59.70%<br />\nCanada 9.60%<br />\nAustralia 7.90%<br />\nNetherlands 4.21%<br />\nGreat Britain 4.02%<br />\nGermany 2.87%<br />\nFrance 2.69%<br />\nBelgium 1.18%<br />\nItaly 0.88%<br />\nNew Zealand 0.88%</td>\n<td>US 62.62%<br />\nCanada 9.33%<br />\nAustralia 8.37%<br />\nGreat Britain 4.20%<br />\nNetherlands 2.98%<br />\nFrance 2.81%<br />\nGermany 2.50%<br />\nItaly 1.19%<br />\nNew Zealand 0.80%<br />\nSpain 0.58%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A few key things to note: Looking at the percent change for the US, we can assume that everything outside US is considered International. This means that when we compare 2021 sales to 2020, we saw that as a percentage of overall sales, international sales grew by 2.92%.</p>\n<p>And if we look at the trend compared to 2018, that difference shows international sales having grown by 10.72% over just a four-year period.</p>\n<p>Year-over-year (YOY) sales growth from 2020 to 2021 shows:</p>\n<p>Australia up 9.21%<br />\nCanada up 3.62%<br />\nSwitzerland up 10.64%<br />\nGermany up 4.76%<br />\nGreat Britain up 15.30%</p>\n<p>This is effectively a story of how authors are using D2D to gain more sales in international markets. And with expansion into new territories (via growth by retailers such as Kobo Plus, into new regions worldwide), the opportunities for authors distributing wide continue to increase.</p>\n<p>Many of these regions, by the way, have no Amazon presence. Which means that authors distributing through KDP Select will not have an opportunity to reach these new markets.</p>\n<p>So, going forward, what sort of data would you like to see? We can’t promise that everything is on the table (again, NDAs and other restrictions do apply). But what insights might help you with making your author career more successful? Leave us a comment and let us know—we might just be able to accommodate your requests in future industry reports!</p>\n<h2>D2D Plans for Your Future</h2>\n<p>As Draft2Digital continues forward in its mission to expand author opportunities and reach, we’re establishing more relationships with both international and US retailers. That’s been a priority since our founding. And with greater reach into both retail and library markets worldwide, the inevitable outcome is greater discoverability. In some cases, we are helping authors reach markets of readers who have had very few alternatives for discovering new authors and books they love.</p>\n<p>Our roadmap for 2022 and beyond includes some pretty big shifts in opening up new markets for authors to reach, including some opportunities we think authors are going to love. The kind of thing we can’t wait to tell you about—pretty amazing stuff.</p>\n<p>As we go forward into a whole new year, it’s with an eye toward supplying you with all new tools and resources to make it much easier for you to build and grow your author career. New markets, new ways to promote, and new opportunities to grow.</p>\n<p>This year, 2021, was a year of recovery and growth. We expect that to continue, going forward, and we’re actively building new tools that are going to take you and your career to the next level. We can’t wait to see what you think of all the surprises coming your way!</p>\n<p>Until then, we want to wish you a safe, healthy, happy and prosperous new year. We’re so very honored to be a part of your author dream, and we promise we are doing everything we can to make that dream happen better and faster than you might ever have expected!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Draft2Digital Team</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/2021-the-year-of-more-author-reach/\">2021: The Year of More Author Reach</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog\">Draft2Digital | Blog</a>.</p>"},"wfw:commentrss":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/2021-the-year-of-more-author-reach/feed/"},"slash:comments":{"@":{},"#":"0"},"rss:post-id":{"@":{"xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1"},"#":"31049"},"meta":{"#ns":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"},{"xmlns:georss":"http://www.georss.org/georss"},{"xmlns:geo":"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"},{"xmlns":"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1"}],"@":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"},{"xmlns:georss":"http://www.georss.org/georss"},{"xmlns:geo":"http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#"}],"#xml":{"version":"1.0","encoding":"UTF-8"},"#type":"rss","#version":"2.0","title":"Draft2Digital | Blog","description":"Distribute your books worldwide.

It takes time, dedication, and consistency. Even the most prolific authors struggle now and then with writer’s block or another version of “life getting in the way.” Which is why, at one point or another, we’ve all had the same thought: “There <em>must </em>be a way to make this process easier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s how, sooner or later, writers end up going down a software rabbit hole, analyzing the tool that’s right in front of our faces for hours upon hours each day: our word processor. So how do you choose the best word processor for writers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a quick disclaimer. One of the perks of writing is its low barrier to entry. You have all the tools you need to do it, right now. Whether you have a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or occasional access to a library computer, you have everything you need to start writing. Heck, a simple legal pad and pen will do the trick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But some tools make writing more manageable than others. In this post, we’ll look at the most popular word processors for writers and break down the pros and cons of each.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cost money, and others are free. Some come with lots of bells and whistles, and others are bare-bones. Is paid software worth the investment, or should you use a free tool?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only <em>you</em> can decide which word processor will work best for you. And although some tools can make certain <em>aspects </em>of writing easier, full disclosure: writing will always be hard—at least for most of us. Even the best software in the world can’t create your magnum opus for you. But it <em>can </em>make the process a little easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scrivener: $49</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview\">Scrivener</a> is one of the best-known word processors on the market, at least among writers. Unlike more generic tools like MS Word, it was created specifically for writers. Other word processors like Word and Google Docs are used by everyone: students, lawyers, teachers, businesspeople, etc. But Scrivener was created with writers in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what can it do that other word processors can’t?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helps with plotting</li><li>Two outlining features: standard and corkboard</li><li>Easy drag and drop to move sections around</li><li>A collection of templates specific to writers (ex: character, setting, front matter, and back matter)</li><li>A distraction-free full-screen mode</li><li>A side panel to store notes, bookmarked websites, and documents related to your book</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization is a significant selling point, too. Instead of keeping everything in one giant file (or lots of disjointed smaller files), Scrivener makes it easy to create multiple sub-files to organize and outline a writing project. On the corkboard, you can view chapters or scenes as index cards, making them easy to reorder by dragging and dropping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some writers swear Scrivener makes them more productive. (You can create word count goals and track your daily progress to stay on target.) Others simply enjoy transitioning to a tool they don’t use for any other type of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some cons—namely, the learning curve. Any software with a robust suite of tools must be learned, unlike the old standbys you can just pick up and use. If you enjoy learning new software, great! But if feeling your way around a tool will slow you down, Scrivener might be more trouble than it’s worth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, collaboration isn’t easy on Scrivener. Many writers with co-authors will write solo in Scrivener and then use Google Docs for the collaborative portion of a project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros of Scrivener:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Created for large book-writing projects</li><li>Zoom out for a high-level view of your book’s structure</li><li>Stay productive with project targets and built-in deadlines, plus a pared-down full-screen view for maximum focus</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons of Scrivener:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Steep learning curve</li><li>Some features feel overly complicated</li><li>Syncing is via Dropbox, which isn’t seamless</li><li>Tricky to collaborate</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vellum: $199</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vellum.pub/\">Vellum</a> is the priciest word processor on our list, but that’s because it functions more like a word processor <em>and </em>a service rolled into one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exporting your word file into ePub format isn’t hard. Scrivener, Word, Pages, and even Google Docs can do it. The problem is, they probably won’t render very well in an e-reader without help. There’s an entire industry based on supporting authors trying to format their ebooks—that’s how difficult it can be to turn a text file into a professional-looking self-published book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enter Vellum, which makes beautiful books.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In under an hour, you can get your book ready for the public eye. The previewer tool lets you see how each formatting change or edit will appear on any major e-reader: Kindle, Fire, iPhone, Nook, Kobo, etc. It also has stripped-down, option-based formatting—perfect for designing either ebooks or print books. (Print comes with an upgraded price tag, though.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vellum is easy and intuitive to use, especially considering its range.

It takes time, dedication, and consistency. Even the most prolific authors struggle now and then with writer’s block or another version of “life getting in the way.” Which is why, at one point or another, we’ve all had the same thought: “There <em>must </em>be a way to make this process easier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s how, sooner or later, writers end up going down a software rabbit hole, analyzing the tool that’s right in front of our faces for hours upon hours each day: our word processor. So how do you choose the best word processor for writers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a quick disclaimer. One of the perks of writing is its low barrier to entry. You have all the tools you need to do it, right now. Whether you have a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or occasional access to a library computer, you have everything you need to start writing. Heck, a simple legal pad and pen will do the trick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But some tools make writing more manageable than others. In this post, we’ll look at the most popular word processors for writers and break down the pros and cons of each.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some cost money, and others are free. Some come with lots of bells and whistles, and others are bare-bones. Is paid software worth the investment, or should you use a free tool?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only <em>you</em> can decide which word processor will work best for you. And although some tools can make certain <em>aspects </em>of writing easier, full disclosure: writing will always be hard—at least for most of us. Even the best software in the world can’t create your magnum opus for you. But it <em>can </em>make the process a little easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Scrivener: $49</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview\">Scrivener</a> is one of the best-known word processors on the market, at least among writers. Unlike more generic tools like MS Word, it was created specifically for writers. Other word processors like Word and Google Docs are used by everyone: students, lawyers, teachers, businesspeople, etc. But Scrivener was created with writers in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So what can it do that other word processors can’t?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helps with plotting</li><li>Two outlining features: standard and corkboard</li><li>Easy drag and drop to move sections around</li><li>A collection of templates specific to writers (ex: character, setting, front matter, and back matter)</li><li>A distraction-free full-screen mode</li><li>A side panel to store notes, bookmarked websites, and documents related to your book</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization is a significant selling point, too. Instead of keeping everything in one giant file (or lots of disjointed smaller files), Scrivener makes it easy to create multiple sub-files to organize and outline a writing project. On the corkboard, you can view chapters or scenes as index cards, making them easy to reorder by dragging and dropping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some writers swear Scrivener makes them more productive. (You can create word count goals and track your daily progress to stay on target.) Others simply enjoy transitioning to a tool they don’t use for any other type of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some cons—namely, the learning curve. Any software with a robust suite of tools must be learned, unlike the old standbys you can just pick up and use. If you enjoy learning new software, great! But if feeling your way around a tool will slow you down, Scrivener might be more trouble than it’s worth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, collaboration isn’t easy on Scrivener. Many writers with co-authors will write solo in Scrivener and then use Google Docs for the collaborative portion of a project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros of Scrivener:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Created for large book-writing projects</li><li>Zoom out for a high-level view of your book’s structure</li><li>Stay productive with project targets and built-in deadlines, plus a pared-down full-screen view for maximum focus</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons of Scrivener:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Steep learning curve</li><li>Some features feel overly complicated</li><li>Syncing is via Dropbox, which isn’t seamless</li><li>Tricky to collaborate</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vellum: $199</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vellum.pub/\">Vellum</a> is the priciest word processor on our list, but that’s because it functions more like a word processor <em>and </em>a service rolled into one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exporting your word file into ePub format isn’t hard. Scrivener, Word, Pages, and even Google Docs can do it. The problem is, they probably won’t render very well in an e-reader without help. There’s an entire industry based on supporting authors trying to format their ebooks—that’s how difficult it can be to turn a text file into a professional-looking self-published book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enter Vellum, which makes beautiful books.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In under an hour, you can get your book ready for the public eye. The previewer tool lets you see how each formatting change or edit will appear on any major e-reader: Kindle, Fire, iPhone, Nook, Kobo, etc. It also has stripped-down, option-based formatting—perfect for designing either ebooks or print books. (Print comes with an upgraded price tag, though.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vellum is easy and intuitive to use, especially considering its range. It makes beautiful styling easy and could save you from hiring someone to format your book before publication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the con side, there’s the price. Vellum isn’t for the faint of heart. Also, there are limited styles available, so you’re subject to their styling options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros of Vellum:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Makes formatting and styling easy</li><li>Exports to MOBI</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons of Vellum:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Lacks some in-built writing features that authors expect, like a collaboration tool&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Microsoft Word: $160 flat fee, or $70/year for Microsoft 365&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/word/cfq7ttc0hlkm?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab\">MS Word</a> is world-famous.
