She was frustrated and discouraged, feeling like she didn’t know what direction to take with her manuscript. She questioned whether anyone would ever want to read her book and, worse, she felt burned and discouraged by her MFA program because she didn’t feel she got the support she needed to write the story she felt compelled to tell. She learned a lot in the MFA program, but not how to actually <em>finish</em> a book. And she wasn’t able to figure out how to make progress on her manuscript without the external structure of the MFA program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you can relate, because I hear these kinds of stories from writers all the time. They can’t seem to make progress on their own, without being in a workshop or MFA program. They also get stuck because they are overwhelmed by the amount of material they have, they don’t know how to organize it, and can’t figure out what structure will work best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The writers I talk to also attempt to get unstuck in similar ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You read all the books and articles on writing you can get your hands on, thinking that if you can just unlock some mysterious craft secret then everything will magically fall into place.</li><li>You attend as many workshops and seminars and master classes as you can, thinking that if you can just get the exact perfect feedback from so-and-so famous author who has all the answers, then you will have all the answers too.</li><li>You keep doing the same things you’ve always done, thinking that if you just spend more time, work harder, attend one more workshop, or get more feedback, you’ll finally figure it out.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s just one problem with this thinking: It’s all a version of expecting <em>external</em> solutions, when the reality is that most of the time the solution is <em>internal</em>. You need to make three internal shifts to help you finish your book and become the writer you’ve always imagined: structure, story, and sanctuary. Let’s take a closer look at each element of this framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"shift-1-embrace-structure\">Shift 1: Embrace structure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking about structure often makes creatives, especially writers, cringe a little bit. You want to write when you’re feeling inspired, when you’re in the mood, or when you feel like it. But the problem with that is you’re making time for your book project in a reactionary way that is sporadic, unsustainable and, ultimately, exhausting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, embracing structure means planning and finding consistency in your creative practice so that you can truly start to see the progress you want to see on your manuscript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can embrace structure in your writing life with these three actions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Work your why.</strong> If you don’t know it already, figure out the WHY behind your book project and your life as a writer. What is the one compelling reason behind writing your book and telling your story? Once you have this, treat it like a vision statement—one sentence that summarizes your WHY, that you can post somewhere you’ll see it everyday, that keeps you motivated to keep returning to your manuscript.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Gather your goals.</strong> Once you have your WHY, identify 3-5 goals that support your vision. These are milestones along the way toward accomplishing your vision, and completing your manuscript. As soon as you achieve one goal, you know you’re that much closer to the finish line.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>Safeguard your schedule.</strong> Now that you have your WHY and your GOALS, you need to establish a schedule that will support both by planning time to take action. Your schedule should be a calendar that you use every day. You don’t do anything unless it’s on your calendar, and you don’t make plans without checking your calendar first. And, most importantly, you treat all appointments as equal, even appointments that are only with yourself.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"shift-2-love-your-story\">Shift 2: Love your story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I say “love your story,” it may sound a little cheesy or even a little cliché. But compared to other things you might say you love, like cooking or playing music or spending time with your family, it becomes pretty clear that you don’t love your story in the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me explain. If you love to cook, you might spend time searching for new recipes. And when you find one you want to try, you might go out of your way to a specialty grocer to pick up some exotic ingredients that they don’t carry at Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s. Because you love it, you nurture it, and infuse the time you spend cooking with tender loving care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s like one of my clients, Susie, says, “It’s not that my manuscript changed, but that I changed in relation to it. I started to believe, ‘Okay, I can write this. I can finish this.’ And that proved to be way more important to me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can begin to love your story with these three actions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Develop your draft.</strong> Sure, it’s easy enough to generate words, get feedback, and revise. Most writers feel like they have that part down. But if you try to force the material into submission and control its outcome, that’s not a very loving way to treat the project. Instead, how can you listen to the draft and let it tell you what it needs? Can you bring a sense of lightness and play into your work, holding it loosely so that it becomes what it’s meant to be?&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Master your mind.</strong> Your mindset affects you more than you know. It creates the story you tell yourself about the story you are writing. One of the best things my therapist ever did for me years ago was to give me the mantra: The story I tell myself creates the reality I experience. So as long as you tell yourself that your story doesn’t matter, that no one will want to read it, or that you don’t have what it takes to write a book—guess what? It will be true.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>Invest in yourself.</strong> When you hear the word “invest” you might automatically think: money. But investing in yourself is about giving yourself—and your book project—what you need to be successful. That means time, energy, attention, and, yes, sometimes money. If you are neglecting yourself, your skill development, or your creative process, then ultimately you are neglecting your story and you won’t make progress toward finishing your book.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"shift-3-create-a-sanctuary\">Shift 3: Create a sanctuary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you hear the word “sanctuary” and think of a physical place, like a church or yoga studio or a botanical garden, in this context I want you to understand it as something you create in your mind so that you can take it with you anywhere you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do that, you can access the mindset and energy you need to work on your book without worrying about whether you are at home with all of your creature comforts or in a hotel room on a personal writing retreat. You can access it at any place and any time because you have everything you need within you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create a sanctuary with these three actions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Renew your rituals.</strong> Reflect on how you begin any time you sit down to work on your book. Is it rushed? Frantic? Forced? You can shift this energy so that it is calming and uplifting by incorporating rituals as a way to begin your writing time. Rituals are habits in an elevated form, an action you take intentionally that triggers your body and mind, and prepares it for the creative work ahead of you.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"2\"><li><strong>Cultivate your creativity.</strong> As a writer, you are naturally curious and creative, and so you are probably drawn to forms of creativity other than writing. But, again, how intentional is it? I like to think of cultivating your creativity as cross training for your brain. It’s a way to stretch and train your creative muscles so that they are stimulated and ready to get to work when you sit down to make some progress on your manuscript.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li><strong>Watch your wellness.</strong> Your physical wellbeing is just as important for making progress on your manuscript as your craft skills and your mental wellbeing. I like to say, when I am not well, my work is not well. Just as athletes train and watch what they eat so that they can perform at their highest level on game day, you need to take care of your body by sleeping well, eating well, moving and exercising every day so that when you sit down to write, you are also ready to perform at your highest level. If you want to have the mental clarity, energy, and stamina required to generate the output necessary for a book-length manuscript, then you must watch your wellness.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have noticed that there is some overlap in each of these shifts and associated actions. Rituals can support mindset, wellness, and creativity; and investing can support all of those things as well. The framework is intentionally designed to be a layered approach, where one aspect supports the next, building on itself to create a more holistic approach to your book project that allows you to integrate your writing with every other aspect of your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s so easy to get caught up seeking external solutions to your problems, when the truth is if you take time to get quiet with yourself, you’ll realize that making these internal shifts will have a profound effect on your progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After working through this framework and making these three internal shifts for herself, not only did Cat finish her memoir manuscript, but she also told me that she now feels the way she wanted to feel at the end of her MFA program: Like a real artist.</p>","summary":"If you’ve been seeking external solutions to your writing problems, these internal shifts might have a more profound effect on your progress.","date":"2022-02-09T10:00:00.000Z","pubdate":"2022-02-09T10:00:00.000Z","pubDate":"2022-02-09T10:00:00.000Z","link":"https://www.janefriedman.com/%ef%bf%bc3-shifts-you-need-to-make-to-finish-your-book/","guid":"https://www.janefriedman.com/?p=57285","author":"Janna Marlies Maron","comments":"https://www.janefriedman.com/%ef%bf%bc3-shifts-you-need-to-make-to-finish-your-book/#comments","origlink":null,"image":{},"source":{},"categories":["Guest Post","Writing Advice"],"enclosures":[],"rss:@":{},"rss:title":{"@":{},"#":"3 Shifts You Need to Make to Finish Your Book"},"rss:link":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.janefriedman.com/%ef%bf%bc3-shifts-you-need-to-make-to-finish-your-book/"},"rss:comments":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.janefriedman.com/%ef%bf%bc3-shifts-you-need-to-make-to-finish-your-book/#comments"},"dc:creator":{"@":{},"#":"Janna Marlies Maron"},"rss:pubdate":{"@":{},"#":"Wed, 09 Feb 2022 10:00:00 +0000"},"rss:category":[{"@":{},"#":"Guest Post"},{"@":{},"#":"Writing Advice"}],"rss:guid":{"@":{"ispermalink":"false"},"#":"https://www.janefriedman.com/?p=57285"},"rss:description":{"@":{},"#":"If you’ve been seeking external solutions to your writing problems, these internal shifts might have a more profound effect on your progress."},"content:encoded":{"@":{},"#":"<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Depositphotos_182966658_L-1000x668.jpeg\" alt=\"Image: Grid notebook surrounded by crumpled balls of paper and half-full coffee mugs.\" class=\"wp-image-57300\" srcset=\"https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Depositphotos_182966658_L-1000x668.jpeg 1000w, https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Depositphotos_182966658_L-449x300.jpeg 449w, https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Depositphotos_182966658_L-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Depositphotos_182966658_L-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Depositphotos_182966658_L.jpeg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s post is by editor, publisher and coach <a href=\"https://moretothestory.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Janna Marlies Maron</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/justjanna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@justjanna</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first met Cat, she had been working on her book for more than three years, since finishing her MFA program.

Still, I loved and trusted my grandmother, so I let her yank it off. After a momentary flash of white-hot pain, I experienced an exquisite relief. Soon after, I adopted “rip it off” as my motto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three decades later, during my master’s in counseling, I discovered James Pennebaker’s research on how writing about difficult events improved your health. The trauma survivor in me saw this as a dream come true. So, I began a memoir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial drafting plan combined Pennebaker’s research with Grandma’s sage wisdom. If ripping off a Band-Aid created some relief, churning out one hundred pages of “look what terrible thing happened” would elevate my health and happiness to the Oprah Winfrey level. Bottle that and I’d become the world’s greatest writing coach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except, the exact opposite happened. Writing about endless pain depressed me. Eventually, I avoided my writing desk. When I did show up, an essential part of me cried, “No, no, no.” If I forced myself to write anyway, the work felt flat and superficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To write sustainably about trauma, you must P.A.CE. yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><u>P</u></strong>roactively engage in self-care.</li><li><strong><u>A</u></strong>ctivate your internal wisdom.</li><li><strong><u>C</u></strong>hoose wisely and keep it contained.</li><li><strong><u>E</u></strong>xplore your stories with curiosity and compassion.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>P.A.C.E. is an integrative approach to writing about trauma that combines proactive self-care, mindful awareness, and targeted strategies that help writers discover insights and resilience inside their painful experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activating your internal wisdom (the A in P.A.C.E.) helps you to assess what you should write, when to get started, and how to manage the process <em>before</em> working on painful material. The process can also help you if you’re feeling stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before you assess, you need to know the difference between journaling and storytelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Journals are private places where we record what’s happened to us. Sometimes we share entries with safe people like close friends or counselors, but they’re not meant for everyone. While you might delve deeper into certain topics, there are no rules to follow and no bar to meet when it comes to the quality of your writing. Journaling is a safe way to bear witness to your experiences and develop insights around them—especially if you’ve never shared these moments with anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memoirs and personal essays are curated stories about transformation that have gone through extensive revision. They’re tailored for a specific audience who will glean wisdom from them. That means you must reveal lessons learned in addition to writing dramatic moments well. Getting these projects to a publishable stage requires critical feedback from writers and editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"assess-your-readiness\">Assess your readiness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in writing personal essays or a memoir about traumatic events, you might have some work to do before your project is ready for a critical eye, let alone the public. Many trauma survivors associate being seen with danger—either because something painful happened when they were seen, or they were not seen in some fundamental way, especially early in life. Wounds around being seen can make workshops and publications feel like a walk through an active minefield.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in writing a story, ask yourself why this experience needs an audience. If your goal is to show others what happened to you, it’s likely you need to journal for a while. This is a normal and healthy part of trauma writing. Early on, we need someone to attend to our wounds. If this is the case, the best audience is a counselor or other mental health professional—not a workshop or writing group. Workshops are designed to help writers improve their storytelling skills. Most writers, no matter how compassionate, aren’t equipped to help you make sense of your pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"assess-your-energy-bank-account\">Assess your energy bank account</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you choose to journal or work on a formal project, you must manage the limited funds in your energy bank account. Rest, self-care, fun, and supportive relationships deposit energy into this account. Everything else draws from it. Illness communities talk about energy levels in terms of spoons. If we feel great, we might wake up with ten spoons. Experiencing a relapse? Cut that number in half. Our job is to use these spoons wisely by selecting the day’s most important tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a writer, replace spoons with pens. You’ll spend most of your pens on daily living. A tiny fraction are for your writing life, so use them well. The more emotionally intense the topic, the more pens you’ll need. If you’re writing about a highly traumatic event, allot at least three to five pens, and an additional pen or two for the recovery time you’ll need <em>after</em> you write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some of you, this is all you’ll need. But if you take pride in a high pain tolerance and an ability to write about hard things no matter what, there are a few stop signs to watch out for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"assess-your-timing\">Assess your timing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to wait for the perfect conditions before working on a tough story, but there are times when writing about trauma won’t serve you. Here are just a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>It’s too soon:</strong> While you can journal any time, stories require enough distance from an event to know what it means—a phenomenon called psychic distance. The amount of time needed to develop psychic distance is relative. For some experiences, all you’ll need is a few days. But if you’re planning to write about a buried-never-spoken-of event, fifty years might not be long enough. Before writing publicly about buried events, work with a trained professional.</li><li><strong>Part of you doesn’t want to:</strong> Motivated writers love to see their work in print, but that doesn’t mean the wounded part of you is ready. Trauma frequently involves a lack of choices or coercion. Forcing yourself to write about painful things can re-enact the trauma you’ve experienced. This can make you hate writing or give up. If part of you is saying no, ask what it needs to feel safe before proceeding.</li><li><strong>You’re going through a major life transition:</strong> Many writers want to capitalize on the extra time a job loss, divorce, maternity leave, surgery, or pandemic had granted them by writing a memoir. But major life changes—even happy ones like a new baby—are stressful, and that stress requires more pens. Your tough times aren’t going anywhere. At these critical junctures, focus on happy times and joyful activities that replenish the pens lost to transition stress.</li><li><strong>This is your first writing rodeo:</strong> If you’re a beginning writer, start with material that has a low to moderate intensity. That way you can focus on developing new skills around scene writing and dialogue rather than how you’ll deal with the pain of reliving a difficult moment.</li><li><strong>Your writing time butts up to important tasks: </strong>Perhaps you write directly before work or before the kids return from school. Writing about traumatic events requires both pens for writing <em>and</em> a recovery period where you’ll rest and regain a full sense of the present moment. If your current writing schedule doesn’t contain any recovery time, rearrange your calendar to create some mental, emotional, and energetic room for your emotionally intense writing sessions.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to writing about trauma there are no gold stars. No one will give you a trophy for writing about unending pain. But you can make yourself miserable and stall what could become a valuable project. Your stories have too much healing potential to treat them like Band-Aids. Proceed gently and P.A.C.E. your writing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note from Jane:</strong> If you enjoyed this post, please join us on Feb. 24 for the online class <a href=\"https://www.janefriedman.com/writing-about-trauma-with-lisa-cooper-ellison/\">Writing About Trauma</a>.</p>","summary":"Writing about trauma isn’t like ripping off a Band-Aid.

It’s not that they are mean-spirited, or jaded, or working too quickly to get through the submission queue. Instead, their experience allows them to instantly recognize when writing doesn’t meet their journal’s standards. Often it’s in the details—in the lack of telling details, that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, very often we begin reading submissions that start with a description of a person or a place. Too often the details offered are flat and generic, describing only superficial aspects. Kind of like reading a police report:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">The man in the airport had brown hair and blue eyes, and wore a black suit and shiny shoes. He walked briskly toward the shuttle to the international terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach creates distance between the reader and the character because it offers no depth, no insight into the person described, and therefore it encourages the writer to adopt an explanatory tone, one that treats the reader as a passive listener who must be educated, lecture style, about the world of the story. But good fiction creates an illusion of real life. If so, then shouldn’t the details of a story be presented in a way that reflects how we discover the world in our real lives, rather than a classroom?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One main key to compelling, immersive fiction is in how details are conveyed. Dull fiction assumes the reader doesn’t know the basics of a scene—if it takes place at a bar, then that bar must be thoroughly described; if it’s a hospital, everyday details about the hospital must be expressed. Good fiction assumes the reader is familiar enough with bars and hospitals to not have to describe them from scratch—only the details that are important to the characters are conveyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which approach is more organic and more effective? Think about how you encounter the world. What things do you notice and what things do you not? Human beings are evolved to notice what is out of the ordinary. We tend to pay less attention to the things we see on a regular basis. This allows us to move forward more efficiently in our lives—imagine what it would be like if we had to pause and consider what the red, yellow, and green meant on a traffic signal every time we encountered one. But because we have seen these signals many times before we don’t have to think about what they mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a simple example, but consider how this applies to fiction. Stories that offer the surface details treat readers as though they don’t know what a traffic signal is for. They tend to describe everything in a scene, even the details that don’t matter:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">At the party, Sue stood against the green wall, watching. There was a landscape painting across from her. She watched people choose beers from the blue ice chest and food from the spread on the linen-covered table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may be real, but it is not life. Do we need to know that the wall is green and had a painting hung from it, or that the ice chest is blue, or that there is beer and food at a party? What does this tell us about Sue? Not much. The writer needs to connect Sue’s surroundings to her character. Also, the delay created by overdetailed description works against the need of a story to move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good stories concede the banal and instead offer details that have deeper meaning. The writer considers, “What would the character notice and why?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s go back to that man in the airport. If you’re in an airport you probably pass hundreds of people on your way to your gate. You can’t notice them all, so what about this man makes him stand out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">The man in the airport seemed to be watching me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to describe his height, weight, hair color, eye color…not until they matter. What matters at the start, and what the character notices, is that he is watching. It’s out of the ordinary. It portends possible danger, or at least something unusual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as for Sue:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">At the party, Sue found a niche away from the crowd, too shy to talk to anyone. These were not her people. But knowing them could mean a big break in her career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We no longer know what the room looked like, but we know several important things about Sue. Which will lead to the more interesting story?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a concept I first encountered reading James Wood’s <em>How Fiction Works.</em> It’s another way of describing close third person POV, but I like the term “telling detail” because it reminds the writer that the details need to inform us not just about what the character saw, but why they mattered—why they are “telling.” And that leads to character depth, the kinds of characters that populate good fiction. We learn about them subtly, through their reactions—how they act and speak in response to the world around them, and the situations in which they find themselves.

It’s not that they are mean-spirited, or jaded, or working too quickly to get through the submission queue. Instead, their experience allows them to instantly recognize when writing doesn’t meet their journal’s standards. Often it’s in the details—in the lack of telling details, that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, very often we begin reading submissions that start with a description of a person or a place. Too often the details offered are flat and generic, describing only superficial aspects. Kind of like reading a police report:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">The man in the airport had brown hair and blue eyes, and wore a black suit and shiny shoes. He walked briskly toward the shuttle to the international terminal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach creates distance between the reader and the character because it offers no depth, no insight into the person described, and therefore it encourages the writer to adopt an explanatory tone, one that treats the reader as a passive listener who must be educated, lecture style, about the world of the story. But good fiction creates an illusion of real life. If so, then shouldn’t the details of a story be presented in a way that reflects how we discover the world in our real lives, rather than a classroom?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One main key to compelling, immersive fiction is in how details are conveyed. Dull fiction assumes the reader doesn’t know the basics of a scene—if it takes place at a bar, then that bar must be thoroughly described; if it’s a hospital, everyday details about the hospital must be expressed. Good fiction assumes the reader is familiar enough with bars and hospitals to not have to describe them from scratch—only the details that are important to the characters are conveyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which approach is more organic and more effective? Think about how you encounter the world. What things do you notice and what things do you not? Human beings are evolved to notice what is out of the ordinary. We tend to pay less attention to the things we see on a regular basis. This allows us to move forward more efficiently in our lives—imagine what it would be like if we had to pause and consider what the red, yellow, and green meant on a traffic signal every time we encountered one. But because we have seen these signals many times before we don’t have to think about what they mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a simple example, but consider how this applies to fiction. Stories that offer the surface details treat readers as though they don’t know what a traffic signal is for. They tend to describe everything in a scene, even the details that don’t matter:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">At the party, Sue stood against the green wall, watching. There was a landscape painting across from her. She watched people choose beers from the blue ice chest and food from the spread on the linen-covered table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may be real, but it is not life. Do we need to know that the wall is green and had a painting hung from it, or that the ice chest is blue, or that there is beer and food at a party? What does this tell us about Sue? Not much. The writer needs to connect Sue’s surroundings to her character. Also, the delay created by overdetailed description works against the need of a story to move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good stories concede the banal and instead offer details that have deeper meaning. The writer considers, “What would the character notice and why?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s go back to that man in the airport. If you’re in an airport you probably pass hundreds of people on your way to your gate. You can’t notice them all, so what about this man makes him stand out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">The man in the airport seemed to be watching me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to describe his height, weight, hair color, eye color…not until they matter. What matters at the start, and what the character notices, is that he is watching. It’s out of the ordinary. It portends possible danger, or at least something unusual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as for Sue:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#faf0e0\">At the party, Sue found a niche away from the crowd, too shy to talk to anyone. These were not her people. But knowing them could mean a big break in her career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We no longer know what the room looked like, but we know several important things about Sue. Which will lead to the more interesting story?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a concept I first encountered reading James Wood’s <em>How Fiction Works.</em> It’s another way of describing close third person POV, but I like the term “telling detail” because it reminds the writer that the details need to inform us not just about what the character saw, but why they mattered—why they are “telling.” And that leads to character depth, the kinds of characters that populate good fiction. We learn about them subtly, through their reactions—how they act and speak in response to the world around them, and the situations in which they find themselves. If fiction is an illusion of real life, then you have to give your reader both parts—the real <em>and</em> the life. It often makes the difference between a dull story and an engrossing one.</p>"},"wfw:commentrss":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.janefriedman.com/use-telling-details-to-connect-description-to-character/feed/"},"slash:comments":{"@":{},"#":"10"},"meta":{"#ns":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"}],"@":[{"xmlns:content":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"},{"xmlns:wfw":"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"},{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"},{"xmlns:atom":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"},{"xmlns:sy":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/"},{"xmlns:slash":"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/"}],"#xml":{"version":"1.0","encoding":"UTF-8"},"#type":"rss","#version":"2.0","title":"Blog | Jane Friedman","description":"Reporting and consulting on the publishing industry","date":"2022-02-09T16:28:04.000Z","pubdate":"2022-02-09T16:28:04.000Z","pubDate":"2022-02-09T16:28:04.000Z","link":"https://www.janefriedman.com/","xmlurl":"https://www.janefriedman.com/blog/feed/","xmlUrl":"https://www.janefriedman.com/blog/feed/","author":null,"language":"en-US","favicon":null,"copyright":null,"generator":"https://wordpress.org/?v=5.9","cloud":{},"image":{"url":"https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Friedman-Icon-copy1-548f4b9d_site_icon-32x32.png","title":"Blog | Jane Friedman"},"categories":[],"rss:@":{},"rss:title":{"@":{},"#":"Blog | Jane Friedman"},"atom:link":{"@":{"href":"https://www.janefriedman.com/blog/feed/","rel":"self","type":"application/rss+xml"}},"rss:link":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.janefriedman.com/"},"rss:description":{"@":{},"#":"Reporting and consulting on the publishing industry"},"rss:lastbuilddate":{"@":{},"#":"Wed, 09 Feb 2022 16:28:04 +0000"},"rss:language":{"@":{},"#":"en-US"},"syn:updateperiod":{"@":{},"#":"hourly"},"syn:updatefrequency":{"@":{},"#":"1"},"rss:generator":{"@":{},"#":"https://wordpress.org/?v=5.9"},"rss:image":{"@":{},"url":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Friedman-Icon-copy1-548f4b9d_site_icon-32x32.png"},"title":{"@":{},"#":"Blog | Jane Friedman"},"link":{"@":{},"#":"https://www.janefriedman.com/"},"width":{"@":{},"#":"32"},"height":{"@":{},"#":"32"}}}},{"title":"When a Writer Dies: Making Difficult Decisions About the Work Left Behind","description":"<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eric_newton_writing_unfinished-1000x667.jpg\" alt=\"Image: a stack of unassembled jigsaw puzzle pieces, topped by a piece with a heart shape painted on it.\" class=\"wp-image-57241\" srcset=\"https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eric_newton_writing_unfinished-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eric_newton_writing_unfinished-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eric_newton_writing_unfinished-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.janefriedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/eric_newton_writing_unfinished.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption>Photo by Tara Winstead from Pexels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s post is by editor and media consultant Eric Newton (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricNewton1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@EricNewton1</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Nine days before my wife died, she forwarded me a Brevity post,<a href=\"https://brevity.wordpress.com/2019/06/04/the-death-of-a-writer/\"> The Death of a Writer,</a> which asked:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Who is going to deal with your literary legacy, and what do you want done?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife wrote,&nbsp;“…interesting re what to do…”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added a lifesaver emoji.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife, Mary Ann Hogan, journalist and teacher, died June 13, 2019, her “tango with lymphoma” ended, her life’s literary work unfinished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her manuscript explored her relationship with her father, William Hogan, longtime literary editor of the <em>San Francisco Chronicle. </em>Though he spent his life writing about books, Bill Hogan never wrote one of his own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary Ann died thinking her book would redeem them both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now what?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-base-background-color has-base-color is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In The Death of a Writer, Allison K Williams reported what she did as a friend’s literary executor.&nbsp;Read everything, she advised.
