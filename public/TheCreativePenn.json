Over the past 37 years, he has helped thousands of authors, including me, to sell more books. Welcome, John.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Thanks a lot, Joanna.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm so excited to talk to you. And you were one of the first people I learned about marketing from, back in 2008, when I self-published my first book. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In case people don't know you, tell us a bit more about your writing and publishing background.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I can't believe it took you 20 years to find me, since I've been publishing since 1984 or 1986, I forget which now. I think it was 1984 when I first started publishing, and writing about publishing and marketing books. So it's been a while. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People find me when they are ready to do something. And that's what you hope will happen with your book, whichever kind of book you're publishing, you hope that when people are ready to find an entertaining read, they find your novel, or they're finding a book for their kids and they find your children's book. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your goal is to stay out there long enough that the people that need you or want you or hope to find you actually do find you.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. We'll circle back to that, but just on your own writing journey,  way back in 1984. Why did you get into publishing in the first place? What is it about the book industry that you love?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I was writing books, and I wanted to get them out somehow. And so, at first, I was just pitching to different publishers, but you know how that goes with a lot of authors. It's like, <strong>if you're not well-known, the publisher doesn't pay attention to you. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decide to self-publish, and then I found, well, gosh, there's nothing out there about how to get your books printed. <strong>Back when I started out, we didn't have print-on-demand. We didn't have Amazon. </strong>What we had is book printers that called themselves short-run book printers, which meant, &#8216;We'll print 10,000 copies for you,' when, as a poor starving artist, you don't want to print more than 500 or 1,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I created a directory of book printers. That was one of my first books, because I needed it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>That's how a lot of us end up writing a book, is because we actually need the information.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's amazing. So, you wrote that nonfiction book, and self-publishing back then, obviously, was just the print copies. <em>1001 Ways to Market Your Books</em> is on its sixth edition, I think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Actually, it's on the seventh edition, the &#8216;Real World Edition.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: The &#8216;Real World Edition.' Oh, okay. Why did you call it the &#8216;Real World Edition?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Because, for the most part, I took out the information about marketing online, because the book would've been too big with all of that information. So I wrote a book about <strong>how to market in the real world</strong>. How to work with bookstores, how to get distribution, how to do publicity, how to get on TV or radio, get into magazines, things like that. I spent a lot of time actually writing about marketing in the real world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was planning to do a follow-up book on marketing online, but the world has chased me around like a little rabbit or something, and I haven't gotten to it yet. I've done little pieces of it. But <strong>the reality is online marketing changes so quickly that you sometimes wonder whether or not it's worth writing a book like that</strong>. And quite honestly, I just haven't gotten to it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's interesting you say that, because there are a lot of things that change so fast, but some things stay the same. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What has stayed the same since you wrote that first edition in terms of marketing principles, or overarching strategies?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: The key thing that you need to still do is <strong>connect with people that can help you</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect with the distributors, the editors, the producers of TV shows, the bloggers, the podcasters, and so on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I did include in the &#8216;Real World Edition' was a step-by-step process of how to go about connecting with important people, either offline or online. There is a really core principle in the &#8216;Real World Edition,' that also does apply to online marketing, in a very, very core way, because <strong>your main job is still to connect with the people who already have the audience you want to reach</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: As an introvert, and I know many of my listeners are introverts. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you have any tips for those of us who are introverts and do not do phone calls?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Basically, I recommend that you <strong>connect with people through email</strong>. That's something that even us shy introverts can do. <strong>You start by their social media</strong>, you start commenting on what they're writing about, what they're doing. You start to try to make some sort of connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, at some point along that line, you actually send out an email to them. And again, as you said, you're an intro&#8230;or, I don't know if you're an introvert or you're just speaking for all the introverts of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, I definitely am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Because I don't feel that you are. But the thing is that <strong>you have to connect with people more than once</strong>. If you send out one email and you say, &#8216;Okay, I did my job of marketing my book. The world's going to come and find me and they're going to march and buy my book through some magic process that I don't know&#8230;' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that that magic process doesn't exist unless you make it happen. So, you do have to, and you have to persist. You have to try to connect.<strong> If you don't connect the first time, you try again</strong>. You really have to be a little bit obnoxious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Maybe persistent?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: And for the introverts in the world, you have to be a whole lot of obnoxious, more than you're comfortable with, to some extent, to connect with the people that you want to connect with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, <strong>the minute you connect with one person, it's almost like then the magic starts to happen. </strong>There is actually some magic that, if you connect with one top influencer, and they write about your book, chances are that other influencers follow that influencer, and they go, &#8216;Okay. If he's going to interview him on his podcast, I want him on my podcast.' And that kind of thing happens, and they start to reach out to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you have to get the doors open, and that means you gotta connect with at least several influencers that actually say, &#8216;Yes, I'd love to do something with you. I'd like to have you on my TV show. I'd like to write an article in a magazine, and feature your book.' Whatever it might be. &#8216;I'd like to do a podcast. I'll blog about you.' Whatever it might be, you know, something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It happens that people will reach out to you. <strong>I was reminded about you and your books because you advertise on Amazon, connecting with my name and my book.</strong> At least you show up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes, exactly. It's interesting, because I was going to say to you, so, I don't pitch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Over the last 15 years, I have barely pitched anyone. What I decided to do was go the attraction marketing route, which was build something where people come to me. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That's basically what has happened with this podcast, is that people pitch me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it's kind of the other way around, because I just hated that whole pitching thing. I guess that's another option, is the attraction marketing, the content marketing, building a blog or a podcast that bring people to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Yes. And I do follow that very specifically. My <a href=\"https://bookmarketingbestsellers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bookmarketingbestsellers.com</a> website has probably 1,000 articles on it now, trying to attract people to find out about me, things like that, then they connect with me and so on. Now, I knew about you for what? Since 2008, I presume, and&#8230;somehow it seems longer than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's the world now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I knew about you, and then, for something I was doing&#8230;I was doing some research, and so <strong>I was looking to see who was advertising on my book page for <em>1001 Ways to Market Your Books</em>. And I saw your books, and I saw you had a book about audio marketing for authors</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was going, &#8216;Okay. That's something I'm working on right now.' I reached out to you to interview you. <strong>Your passive marketing worked in that way.</strong> But you're not really passive marketing when you're doing advertising on Amazon, which I think almost every author should do, especially an unknown author, because it's one way to get people to notice you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. And I should say on that, that I do pay a freelancer (at <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/reedsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reedsy</a>) to manage my Amazon advertising, because I'm not so into all the data stuff myself. So, yes, I agree. Doing it is very important, but many authors struggle with those skills. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Would that be another tip? Hire professionals to help you if you can't or don't want to do it yourself?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Yes. Hire somebody. If you don't like doing that particular activity or you don't want to do it, or you don't have the time to do it, then hire somebody that can do it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that costs some money. And <strong>for most authors, they have actually more time than money.</strong> But the neat thing about advertising on something like Amazon, or Facebook, or Google or wherever you might want to advertise, is that most online marketing, you can set a budget, even a small budget, $10 a week or $25 a week, and at least test the market and see if by advertising you make book sales, or you make connections, or in some way, it helps you move along in your goal to become a bestselling author.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can actually target, like you do on Amazon. You target the people that are trying to find me, or my book. And as a result, they also find your book. And that's a beautiful tie-in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like creating relationships, whether it's in that passive way, through advertising on Amazon, or it's a more aggressive way, where you're trying to reach out to people. A lot of authors, as you say, are introvert, they love nothing better than to sit in their room and write books, and they don't want to be spending the time doing the marketing that, quite honestly, needs to be done. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some way, again, you can use your passive way, or the attractive model, which works sometimes, and sometimes doesn't work. But I think authors have to be a little bit more aggressive than they want to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think the title of your book, <em>1001 Ways to Market Your Books</em>, demonstrates how many options there are. And I feel like a lot of authors get overwhelmed with all the possibilities of what can be done, and perhaps what should be done. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does an author decide what to focus on and what to ignore, and to pick a handful of things that they can become good at?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: The criteria for what you do to market your book, I can give you some of the criteria. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One is you have to be able to afford it.</strong> So, you're not going to probably hire a plane to fly over a beach and say, &#8216;Buy my book' or something like that, because that's expensive. You're probably not going to hire a $10,000 a month publicist. You have to work within your budget, whatever that is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing, <strong>you have to have the time to do it</strong>. So, if there's something that takes an incredible amount of time, you're probably not going to do it. But there are things you can do that don't take a lot of time, and that's what you would try to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, beyond that, you have to look at, <strong>&#8216;What connections do I have? Who do I know?'</strong> Because that's one criteria. Now, ideally, if you've been writing a book, you've found out about some of the other thought leaders in the area that you're writing about, whether it's a children's book author, or a novelist, or non-fiction. And so, you reach out to them if you can. But you try to make the connections early. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Ferris, when he did <em>The 4-hour Workweek</em>, he started by just connecting with internet marketers, because he thought internet marketers, they're lazy, so they'd like my book about working four hours a week. And they did. They fell in love with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went to a lot of internet marketing conferences, and he just went up to people and said, &#8216;How can I help you?' So <strong>he didn't say, &#8216;How can you help me?' He went in and said, &#8216;How can I help you?'</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>He'd take people out for drinks or out to dinner, and he'd just talk to them, and talk about what he's working on in the conversation, he was mainly asking him about them and what they were doing and how they were working, but he also would mention what he was doing with his book. By the time he was ready to publish his book, he had several hundred internet marketers with big mailing lists, ready to talk about his book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually started selling so well that major media started going, &#8216;What is this book? Why is it selling?' And they'd reach out to him. He eventually, I think within the first couple weeks of his book being out, he had some major TV shows wanting to interview him. But it started with his online marketing and his connections with a lot of people that had big lists that they mailed out to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You're right. I remember that. And Gary Vaynerchuk as well was just coming into his first book at that time. And, of course, both Tim and Gary are now absolutely huge in the online space and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Right. And have huge audiences and are top influencers on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: You said right at the beginning there, it's about also staying out there long enough that people notice what you do, or they eventually look for what you do.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: That's one reason that I actually say that you should think about marketing&#8230; If you love the book you wrote, spend three years marketing it. That doesn't mean you spend full-time marketing your book. <strong>You go out there and at least do one thing a day for that book for three years. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You think it's something you do. You send out an email to somebody, you do a podcast episode, which you talked about it as being one of the passive ways to do things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, that's what I'm writing about. I'm trying to teach people how to start up their own podcast, and how to get noticed through that podcast. Because a lot of authors, I tell them, &#8216;Do a podcast.' And they don't.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It is hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: <strong>I'm creating a course through email, and I'm sending it out to them through my paid email newsletter on Substack</strong>. And what I do is I tell them, &#8216;Here's the first step. Here's what you have to do to set up your podcast. It's not that complicated.' And then I'm going to be teaching them how to syndicate that podcast, which you love, because it's passive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you create a podcast and you set up the syndication, all you have to do is create more episodes, because the syndication will take place automatically. And that's one of the really, really neat things about doing a podcast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a podcast be on top 20 websites, like Apple Podcasts, and Google Play, and Spotify, and so on. You just syndicate them, and boom, every episode you do will show up on those platforms. And you don't have to necessarily do the marketing. People can discover your podcast through their favorite podcast listening tool. And for most people, that's iTunes, but Spotify is making a big, big push.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Actually, I think Spotify has overtaken Apple now, Apple Podcasts, in quite a few markets. [<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Oh, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I've certainly changed my listening to Spotify. And I think, just even more from what you're saying is that what has changed in even the last 18 months is the voice recognition is so good now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SEO (search engine optimization) for voice is really starting to work. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I'm interested in a topic, whereas I used to go on Google and search for an article, now I go on Spotify and I type in a title or something, like keywords, and then I find podcast episodes on that topic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <strong>I'm actually using Spotify as a search engine for audio</strong>. And they also feed in transcripts now. So, all of my whole transcripts go in, which, as you know, is very good for search engine optimization. So, you're exactly right. It's only getting better for audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Well, and the thing is that Spotify, they're really, even now, today, still trying to build up their podcast listening audience, because they make a lot of money in the advertising versus within the podcast. It's become a major source of income for them, so they're actually trying to grow their podcasting platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's a great time to get in and to syndicate your podcast on iTunes and Spotify and other places. Because, even on Amazon, Audible is looking for more podcasts. Because to them, it's free content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: How do you feel about audio versus blogging? When I first started out and found you, it was start a blog, that's the way to get people to discover you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is it now that the podcast is the new blog, or social media is the new blog, or does blogging and articles still have a purpose?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: They have a purpose because search engines can still discover you that way. But I think, for most authors, they'd be better off doing a podcast at this point. Audio is hot, and the neat thing is that with a podcast, you can also do a video version of your podcast, and put it up on YouTube and Vimeo, and a key source right now is Rumble. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumble is sort of the free speech alternative. A lot of people think Rumble is just a political platform, but it isn't. The most popular videos on Rumble are about dogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, wow. That's just like YouTube, the beginning days of YouTube, when everyone's like, &#8216;Oh, it's just, like, funny cat videos.' And now it's obviously not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Right. And the thing is that if I were starting off in video, just plain old video, my first choice would be Rumble because it's sort of like YouTube in its beginning days, when you could actually get discovered on YouTube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, what do they do is something like a million videos a day, new ones, or something like that. So it's really competitive. Will people find you? They might, but in the old days, YouTube used to have this wonderful algorithm that if you played off of a popular video that was already on YouTube, they would discover your video as well. And it would be one of the top videos on the sidebar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's no longer the case on YouTube. So often, I'll be searching for something on YouTube, I'll find one video, but I'll look at that one and all the other videos are totally unrelated to the video I'm watching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: They're probably paid ads or something. <strong>That video thing is what's kind of happening on TikTok, is people are relating videos and responding on videos</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does bring me to another point. You said that in the old days, which was classic because you could just mean last year at this point, when we, again, when I found you, MySpace was still around, which, of course, went the way of the Dodo. And some people say Facebook's maybe on its way out, and even Instagram, people moving to TikTok, and maybe blogs are gone, and blah, blah, blah. We just can't keep up with all this stuff. It is not practical for authors to just keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm not going anywhere near TikTok. Just not doing it. And I don't blog anymore. I'm focused on podcasting. How do we know when to let something go? Because it's almost like that sunk cost fallacy. It's like, &#8216;Oh, but I've been building my platform here or doing this for a decade. I just don't want to give it up.' </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do we know when we need to give up one way of marketing and find another one?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: <strong>When it's not producing results</strong> is one of the best ways to know. If you're not selling books any longer through that particular platform or whatever you're doing, nobody's discovering you, nobody's emailing you, things like that, then you know that, &#8216;Okay. What I'm doing now isn't working.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a lot of friends that are in internet marketing, so I'm pretty in touch with people there, and one of the things they're telling me is that Facebook advertising isn't working anymore. Not like in the old days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there was a time when you could run a Facebook ad and you could sell a thousand of almost anything. It was like you were reaching out then, the Facebook ads were reaching people. But that's not really happening now. Not in the same way that it was. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't see as many ads when I go to visit Facebook as I used to. I'm not sure quite what Facebook is doing to make money, but I'm sure they're still making money. Even in Facebook, they're going more and more towards virtual spaces and Oculus and things like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will be a new frontier at some point, but I don't think there are very many authors who are selling books by tweeting. Twitter used to be a hot platform, but I don't hear about many authors who are actually selling books that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: For me, Twitter comes back to what you talked about at the beginning, which is connection. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my author friends are people I met on Twitter. Many of my paid speaking engagements have come from Twitter. Because Twitter is my number one social platform, that's what I focused on since 2009 when I joined. So, for me, it's the top of my funnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Hey, if it's still working, then you use it. I don't get any traffic from Twitter. I check my websites to see how people are coming to it. My top referral engine is the search engines. My second referral, and probably very close to being equal, and some days surpassing, is Pinterest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's interesting. I do use some Pinterest. Do you use it a lot, Pinterest?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: It depends on how you mean a lot. I pin probably three times a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: But <strong>if you know how to pin, if you know what to pin, you can get a lot of traffic through Pinterest</strong>. I created a course about Pinterest, &#8216;Real Fast Social Graphics,' that I partnered with Daniel Hall on. Most of the content is mine, but Daniel's got all the connections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talked about connecting with people. I use Daniel for that, because he loves doing that part of the promotion, and I love creating the content. So it's a great partnership. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find a partnership</strong> like that for yourself. Somebody that loves doing some marketing aspect that you don't like to do, and you do the other part, and you guys work together, and you make a sale or something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm doing something now, coming up, I have a friend, Rudy Shur, he's a publisher at Square One Publishing. And he publishes a number of books on writing and marketing. So, he and I and a few other people are going to partner together to co-op market, market each other, market a book, put together a package, something like that. I think that's a great idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I think all authors should be connecting with other authors, and doing some sort of co-op marketing where you help each other.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: There are quite a lot of newsletter swaps, and blog tours, and that kind of thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I don't think blog tours work anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, I'm glad you said that. I completely agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: <strong>I think a podcast tour could work</strong>. In other words, you connect with 5 or 10 key podcasts, people who are podcasting in your area, and I would probably approach those podcasters by first saying, &#8216;I'd like to interview you,' which is what I did with you, and then you said, &#8216;Well, I want to interview you.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it doesn't always happen that they come out right away and say, &#8216;Well, let's interview each other.' But once you do an interview with somebody, let's say you interview them, and they had a great time, there's a very good chance that they're going to come back and say, &#8216;Hey, I want to interview you for my podcast.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Again, that's about that connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to email, because I signed up for your Substack — <a href=\"https://bookmarketing.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://bookmarketing.substack.com/</a>  —&nbsp; and I feel like one of the principles that I guess we've often had with marketing is it's better to own your own email list, it's better to control your platform, and what if they change the terms and all this. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you use Substack, and what's your email marketing principle at the moment?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Subststack.com is a free platform. It doesn't cost anything. You can build up a list of 10,000 people, and they will email for you for free. So, it's a no-brainer to me, because they make their money when you upgrade people to a paid version of your newsletter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Substack, I have a free newsletter that goes out to thousands of people, and that's free. At least a couple times a week, I'll send out something free. But then I also upgrade them to the paid version and in the paid version, that's where I'm teaching people a lot of the inside secrets that take a little bit longer to get into. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want that inside secrets, if you want my course on how to use Substack to market your books, and how to use podcasting to market your books, you pay me. You sign up for the paid version of the newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's all run through Substack. <strong>The neat thing is that Substack, besides that email capability, and the paid version, which is like a membership site, they also offer podcasting.</strong> So you can do your podcasting on Substack, for free. No charge, and it's up and running, and you can syndicate it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They help you get connected with a number of top platforms. I think they do Apple Podcasts, and I think they do Spotify. I forget right now. I'm just working on that lesson now. But they help you connect with at least five of the top podcasting syndication services, the ones that will help get you the exposure you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Substack, it's all free, because <strong>they make their money on taking a piece of the action when you upgrade people to your paid newsletter</strong>. And, everybody, I don't care what kind of author you are, whether it's fiction or whatever, there's always an opportunity to upgrade people to a paid version of your newsletter, where they get insider tips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you're writing a novel, I guarantee you that if you're writing fiction and you have three or four books in that fiction series, there are people that are going to want to connect with you personally, and you can connect to them in an insider's club on Substack, where they pay you, say, $30 a year or $5 a month, something like that, and they get special emails from you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They get the opportunity to maybe meet you somewhere, or a Zoom session with you, or whatever it might be, that it's an upgrade. You can do this if you're writing memoirs, children's books, it doesn't matter. <strong>People want to make connections with you. </strong>The guy that wrote&#8230;I think it was Andy Weir. I think that was his name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah. Wrote <em>The Martian</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: He started podcasting his book as he was writing it. He got 80,000 people listening to his podcast because he was writing his book, and he said, &#8216;Well, I'll just podcast it. I'll read it out as I'm writing it.' And he built up such an audience that they said, &#8216;Andy, you gotta write a book.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Note from Joanna: <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/author-discusses-how-martian-went-blog-blockbuster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Andy Weir blogged his book, not podcasted it</a>. But the same principle applies!]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because at the time, he was just podcasting some thoughts and ideas, initially, and then he started writing the book and podcasting that. He built up the 80,000 readers. They all wanted his book when it was ready to come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. He did really well. And a lot of people use Patreon, including me, which does email people who support you, and I put extra audio and things on there. It's interesting how many of these other options there are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to ask you about this, because, of course, you have built essentially a non-fiction business around one key book, and then obviously, you have tons of other books, and products, and courses, and things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wondered if you'd talk about what are these multiple streams of income. Because many people think, &#8216;Oh, I just have to make my income from book sales.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that's not true, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>John: The most successful authors don't make all their money just from book sales. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They're making it by going out and speaking, and getting paid for speaking, if you're nonfiction. If they're fiction, they're probably selling the rights to their book to make a movie out of, like <em>The Martian</em>, or the kid's book series from the British author.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Harry Potter has his own theme park, for goodness sake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Well, I mean, she became a billionaire, not from selling books. She would've been a millionaire from selling books. She became a billionaire by selling the rights to the movies. And there's a lot of that you can do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, <strong>for a lot of authors, the best thing you could do is to create some sort of course built around your book</strong>. If you're a fiction author, people that read fiction, almost all of them dream at some point about writing a book themselves. So, if nothing else, if you're a fiction author, you could teach people how to publish and become successful with doing a fiction book. You did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: You could just take them through the steps of what you did, in terms of marketing your book, and go from there. Children's book authors, the same way. Almost every adult that reads children's books dreams of writing one themselves. And almost everybody has a book inside them of some sort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's one reason that part of my content that I do in some of my websites has nothing to do with marketing or books in general. It's just a way of attracting people to my website, so they can discover, because <strong>I believe almost everybody has a book inside them.</strong> So the world is my audience for how to market a book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, obviously, not everybody's going to be interested in that, but at some point, I think a lot of people really do dream of writing a book. And why not capture that as soon as you can?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing is that a lot of people have discovered my marketing information through the information that I share on&#8230; I have a sort of a hobby website called myincrediblewebsite.com. I started out that website just to use it as an example when I was doing a course on how to market online and how to create a website. So I created a website, I made videos about it. I called it &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.myincrediblewebsite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">My Incredible Website</a>.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, I loved having it, because it's like my hobby website. Everything that doesn't fit into book marketing, I throw on that website. I have a whole section on how to pray, and I'm writing several books on that topic coming up. I share my other hobbies, like, I love TV series, so I actually have a whole set of pages on that website about where TV series are set. Are they in Texas? Are they in Missouri? Are they in Michigan? Things like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just fascinates me how people will create a TV series. They're built around a strange town in Washington state, or Oregon, or whatever. So I started collecting that information. I'm a packrat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: We're almost out of time, but I do want to ask you about this, because if anyone goes to <strong>your websites, they are absolutely packed with content</strong>. And as you've talked about, <strong>you learn something, and you turn it into an article, or a course, or another email, or a book, and even your hobbies, you're turning into other things</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm the same. I started a second podcast, &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel</a>,' because I love walking and travel and that kind of thing. We take something, we learn something, and we turn it into something else, like the kind of creative thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm in awe of your productivity. How do you manage your time? And this is also a question about marketing. One of the things that people say is, &#8216;Well, how do I balance my time?' Do you have any productivity tips, since you are incredibly productive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I am, but that's just because I'm persistent. I'm actually ADHD in some way. I just jump from one thing to another. It's hard for me to stay focused sometimes and end up finishing a book. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The key thing is, if you're going to do marketing, do at least one thing a day. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do one thing a day, whether it's send out an email, do a podcast episode, get interviewed by somebody else, over time, that's 365 action items a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If any of them are even targeted a little bit towards reaching out to the audience you want to reach out to, you're going to start to get noticed. <strong>Most authors give up marketing after about two weeks.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing is, is that you have to do something every day, for every book that you wrote and love. Ideally, at some point, you find somebody that's even better at marketing your books than you are. For me, that was Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen. They loved my book, &#8216;1001 Ways.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack actually has a video where he talks about putting my entire book up on the wall, basically the ideas, and then acting on them, and taking them down as he acted on those ideas. He did five things a day. Most of the time, it was being interviewed or something like that, or reaching out to people that could interview him, because, of course, <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em> was a wonderful interview subject because all he had to do is tell one of the stories and people would be bawling on the other side of the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I heard Jack and Mark speak and they told a story from <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em>, the first book, I had tears streaming down my face. I just let it out. It was such a moving story, and it did make me cry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And look at that franchise now. That franchise is a juggernaut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: They've actually, almost close to 800 million books, and I think they're moving up towards a billion. And the thing is that they did what they loved doing. And it was really interesting because they told me, &#8216;We sent it out to 250 publishers and they all rejected us.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The publishers believed that short stories don't sell. <strong>But what the publishers didn't understand is that book was backed by 100 professional speakers. </strong>And every one of those speakers had a stake in that book being a success. And boy, it wasn't just Jack and Mark marketing that book. It was 100 speakers, professional speakers, getting out there and saying, &#8216;This is an incredible book. You should buy it.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. Right. Well, we could talk all day, but we're out of time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and your books and courses and everything you do online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: At <a href=\"https://bookmarketingbestsellers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bookmarketingbestsellers.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant.

Over the past 37 years, he has helped thousands of authors, including me, to sell more books. Welcome, John.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Thanks a lot, Joanna.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm so excited to talk to you. And you were one of the first people I learned about marketing from, back in 2008, when I self-published my first book. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In case people don't know you, tell us a bit more about your writing and publishing background.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I can't believe it took you 20 years to find me, since I've been publishing since 1984 or 1986, I forget which now. I think it was 1984 when I first started publishing, and writing about publishing and marketing books. So it's been a while. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People find me when they are ready to do something. And that's what you hope will happen with your book, whichever kind of book you're publishing, you hope that when people are ready to find an entertaining read, they find your novel, or they're finding a book for their kids and they find your children's book. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your goal is to stay out there long enough that the people that need you or want you or hope to find you actually do find you.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. We'll circle back to that, but just on your own writing journey,  way back in 1984. Why did you get into publishing in the first place? What is it about the book industry that you love?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I was writing books, and I wanted to get them out somehow. And so, at first, I was just pitching to different publishers, but you know how that goes with a lot of authors. It's like, <strong>if you're not well-known, the publisher doesn't pay attention to you. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decide to self-publish, and then I found, well, gosh, there's nothing out there about how to get your books printed. <strong>Back when I started out, we didn't have print-on-demand. We didn't have Amazon. </strong>What we had is book printers that called themselves short-run book printers, which meant, &#8216;We'll print 10,000 copies for you,' when, as a poor starving artist, you don't want to print more than 500 or 1,000. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I created a directory of book printers. That was one of my first books, because I needed it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>That's how a lot of us end up writing a book, is because we actually need the information.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's amazing. So, you wrote that nonfiction book, and self-publishing back then, obviously, was just the print copies. <em>1001 Ways to Market Your Books</em> is on its sixth edition, I think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Actually, it's on the seventh edition, the &#8216;Real World Edition.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: The &#8216;Real World Edition.' Oh, okay. Why did you call it the &#8216;Real World Edition?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Because, for the most part, I took out the information about marketing online, because the book would've been too big with all of that information. So I wrote a book about <strong>how to market in the real world</strong>. How to work with bookstores, how to get distribution, how to do publicity, how to get on TV or radio, get into magazines, things like that. I spent a lot of time actually writing about marketing in the real world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was planning to do a follow-up book on marketing online, but the world has chased me around like a little rabbit or something, and I haven't gotten to it yet. I've done little pieces of it. But <strong>the reality is online marketing changes so quickly that you sometimes wonder whether or not it's worth writing a book like that</strong>. And quite honestly, I just haven't gotten to it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's interesting you say that, because there are a lot of things that change so fast, but some things stay the same. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What has stayed the same since you wrote that first edition in terms of marketing principles, or overarching strategies?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: The key thing that you need to still do is <strong>connect with people that can help you</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect with the distributors, the editors, the producers of TV shows, the bloggers, the podcasters, and so on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I did include in the &#8216;Real World Edition' was a step-by-step process of how to go about connecting with important people, either offline or online. There is a really core principle in the &#8216;Real World Edition,' that also does apply to online marketing, in a very, very core way, because <strong>your main job is still to connect with the people who already have the audience you want to reach</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: As an introvert, and I know many of my listeners are introverts. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you have any tips for those of us who are introverts and do not do phone calls?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Basically, I recommend that you <strong>connect with people through email</strong>. That's something that even us shy introverts can do. <strong>You start by their social media</strong>, you start commenting on what they're writing about, what they're doing. You start to try to make some sort of connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, at some point along that line, you actually send out an email to them. And again, as you said, you're an intro&#8230;or, I don't know if you're an introvert or you're just speaking for all the introverts of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, I definitely am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Because I don't feel that you are. But the thing is that <strong>you have to connect with people more than once</strong>. If you send out one email and you say, &#8216;Okay, I did my job of marketing my book. The world's going to come and find me and they're going to march and buy my book through some magic process that I don't know&#8230;' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that that magic process doesn't exist unless you make it happen. So, you do have to, and you have to persist. You have to try to connect.<strong> If you don't connect the first time, you try again</strong>. You really have to be a little bit obnoxious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Maybe persistent?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: And for the introverts in the world, you have to be a whole lot of obnoxious, more than you're comfortable with, to some extent, to connect with the people that you want to connect with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, <strong>the minute you connect with one person, it's almost like then the magic starts to happen. </strong>There is actually some magic that, if you connect with one top influencer, and they write about your book, chances are that other influencers follow that influencer, and they go, &#8216;Okay. If he's going to interview him on his podcast, I want him on my podcast.' And that kind of thing happens, and they start to reach out to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you have to get the doors open, and that means you gotta connect with at least several influencers that actually say, &#8216;Yes, I'd love to do something with you. I'd like to have you on my TV show. I'd like to write an article in a magazine, and feature your book.' Whatever it might be. &#8216;I'd like to do a podcast. I'll blog about you.' Whatever it might be, you know, something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It happens that people will reach out to you. <strong>I was reminded about you and your books because you advertise on Amazon, connecting with my name and my book.</strong> At least you show up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes, exactly. It's interesting, because I was going to say to you, so, I don't pitch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Over the last 15 years, I have barely pitched anyone. What I decided to do was go the attraction marketing route, which was build something where people come to me. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That's basically what has happened with this podcast, is that people pitch me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it's kind of the other way around, because I just hated that whole pitching thing. I guess that's another option, is the attraction marketing, the content marketing, building a blog or a podcast that bring people to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Yes. And I do follow that very specifically. My <a href=\"https://bookmarketingbestsellers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bookmarketingbestsellers.com</a> website has probably 1,000 articles on it now, trying to attract people to find out about me, things like that, then they connect with me and so on. Now, I knew about you for what? Since 2008, I presume, and&#8230;somehow it seems longer than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's the world now!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I knew about you, and then, for something I was doing&#8230;I was doing some research, and so <strong>I was looking to see who was advertising on my book page for <em>1001 Ways to Market Your Books</em>. And I saw your books, and I saw you had a book about audio marketing for authors</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was going, &#8216;Okay. That's something I'm working on right now.' I reached out to you to interview you. <strong>Your passive marketing worked in that way.</strong> But you're not really passive marketing when you're doing advertising on Amazon, which I think almost every author should do, especially an unknown author, because it's one way to get people to notice you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. And I should say on that, that I do pay a freelancer (at <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/reedsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reedsy</a>) to manage my Amazon advertising, because I'm not so into all the data stuff myself. So, yes, I agree. Doing it is very important, but many authors struggle with those skills. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Would that be another tip? Hire professionals to help you if you can't or don't want to do it yourself?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Yes. Hire somebody. If you don't like doing that particular activity or you don't want to do it, or you don't have the time to do it, then hire somebody that can do it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that costs some money. And <strong>for most authors, they have actually more time than money.</strong> But the neat thing about advertising on something like Amazon, or Facebook, or Google or wherever you might want to advertise, is that most online marketing, you can set a budget, even a small budget, $10 a week or $25 a week, and at least test the market and see if by advertising you make book sales, or you make connections, or in some way, it helps you move along in your goal to become a bestselling author.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can actually target, like you do on Amazon. You target the people that are trying to find me, or my book. And as a result, they also find your book. And that's a beautiful tie-in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like creating relationships, whether it's in that passive way, through advertising on Amazon, or it's a more aggressive way, where you're trying to reach out to people. A lot of authors, as you say, are introvert, they love nothing better than to sit in their room and write books, and they don't want to be spending the time doing the marketing that, quite honestly, needs to be done. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some way, again, you can use your passive way, or the attractive model, which works sometimes, and sometimes doesn't work. But I think authors have to be a little bit more aggressive than they want to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think the title of your book, <em>1001 Ways to Market Your Books</em>, demonstrates how many options there are. And I feel like a lot of authors get overwhelmed with all the possibilities of what can be done, and perhaps what should be done. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does an author decide what to focus on and what to ignore, and to pick a handful of things that they can become good at?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: The criteria for what you do to market your book, I can give you some of the criteria. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One is you have to be able to afford it.</strong> So, you're not going to probably hire a plane to fly over a beach and say, &#8216;Buy my book' or something like that, because that's expensive. You're probably not going to hire a $10,000 a month publicist. You have to work within your budget, whatever that is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing, <strong>you have to have the time to do it</strong>. So, if there's something that takes an incredible amount of time, you're probably not going to do it. But there are things you can do that don't take a lot of time, and that's what you would try to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, beyond that, you have to look at, <strong>&#8216;What connections do I have? Who do I know?'</strong> Because that's one criteria. Now, ideally, if you've been writing a book, you've found out about some of the other thought leaders in the area that you're writing about, whether it's a children's book author, or a novelist, or non-fiction. And so, you reach out to them if you can. But you try to make the connections early. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Ferris, when he did <em>The 4-hour Workweek</em>, he started by just connecting with internet marketers, because he thought internet marketers, they're lazy, so they'd like my book about working four hours a week. And they did. They fell in love with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went to a lot of internet marketing conferences, and he just went up to people and said, &#8216;How can I help you?' So <strong>he didn't say, &#8216;How can you help me?' He went in and said, &#8216;How can I help you?'</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>He'd take people out for drinks or out to dinner, and he'd just talk to them, and talk about what he's working on in the conversation, he was mainly asking him about them and what they were doing and how they were working, but he also would mention what he was doing with his book. By the time he was ready to publish his book, he had several hundred internet marketers with big mailing lists, ready to talk about his book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually started selling so well that major media started going, &#8216;What is this book? Why is it selling?' And they'd reach out to him. He eventually, I think within the first couple weeks of his book being out, he had some major TV shows wanting to interview him. But it started with his online marketing and his connections with a lot of people that had big lists that they mailed out to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You're right. I remember that. And Gary Vaynerchuk as well was just coming into his first book at that time. And, of course, both Tim and Gary are now absolutely huge in the online space and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Right. And have huge audiences and are top influencers on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: You said right at the beginning there, it's about also staying out there long enough that people notice what you do, or they eventually look for what you do.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: That's one reason that I actually say that you should think about marketing&#8230; If you love the book you wrote, spend three years marketing it. That doesn't mean you spend full-time marketing your book. <strong>You go out there and at least do one thing a day for that book for three years. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You think it's something you do. You send out an email to somebody, you do a podcast episode, which you talked about it as being one of the passive ways to do things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, that's what I'm writing about. I'm trying to teach people how to start up their own podcast, and how to get noticed through that podcast. Because a lot of authors, I tell them, &#8216;Do a podcast.' And they don't.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It is hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: <strong>I'm creating a course through email, and I'm sending it out to them through my paid email newsletter on Substack</strong>. And what I do is I tell them, &#8216;Here's the first step. Here's what you have to do to set up your podcast. It's not that complicated.' And then I'm going to be teaching them how to syndicate that podcast, which you love, because it's passive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you create a podcast and you set up the syndication, all you have to do is create more episodes, because the syndication will take place automatically. And that's one of the really, really neat things about doing a podcast. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a podcast be on top 20 websites, like Apple Podcasts, and Google Play, and Spotify, and so on. You just syndicate them, and boom, every episode you do will show up on those platforms. And you don't have to necessarily do the marketing. People can discover your podcast through their favorite podcast listening tool. And for most people, that's iTunes, but Spotify is making a big, big push.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Actually, I think Spotify has overtaken Apple now, Apple Podcasts, in quite a few markets. [<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Oh, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I've certainly changed my listening to Spotify. And I think, just even more from what you're saying is that what has changed in even the last 18 months is the voice recognition is so good now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SEO (search engine optimization) for voice is really starting to work. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I'm interested in a topic, whereas I used to go on Google and search for an article, now I go on Spotify and I type in a title or something, like keywords, and then I find podcast episodes on that topic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <strong>I'm actually using Spotify as a search engine for audio</strong>. And they also feed in transcripts now. So, all of my whole transcripts go in, which, as you know, is very good for search engine optimization. So, you're exactly right. It's only getting better for audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Well, and the thing is that Spotify, they're really, even now, today, still trying to build up their podcast listening audience, because they make a lot of money in the advertising versus within the podcast. It's become a major source of income for them, so they're actually trying to grow their podcasting platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's a great time to get in and to syndicate your podcast on iTunes and Spotify and other places. Because, even on Amazon, Audible is looking for more podcasts. Because to them, it's free content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: How do you feel about audio versus blogging? When I first started out and found you, it was start a blog, that's the way to get people to discover you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is it now that the podcast is the new blog, or social media is the new blog, or does blogging and articles still have a purpose?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: They have a purpose because search engines can still discover you that way. But I think, for most authors, they'd be better off doing a podcast at this point. Audio is hot, and the neat thing is that with a podcast, you can also do a video version of your podcast, and put it up on YouTube and Vimeo, and a key source right now is Rumble. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumble is sort of the free speech alternative. A lot of people think Rumble is just a political platform, but it isn't. The most popular videos on Rumble are about dogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, wow. That's just like YouTube, the beginning days of YouTube, when everyone's like, &#8216;Oh, it's just, like, funny cat videos.' And now it's obviously not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Right. And the thing is that if I were starting off in video, just plain old video, my first choice would be Rumble because it's sort of like YouTube in its beginning days, when you could actually get discovered on YouTube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, what do they do is something like a million videos a day, new ones, or something like that. So it's really competitive. Will people find you? They might, but in the old days, YouTube used to have this wonderful algorithm that if you played off of a popular video that was already on YouTube, they would discover your video as well. And it would be one of the top videos on the sidebar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's no longer the case on YouTube. So often, I'll be searching for something on YouTube, I'll find one video, but I'll look at that one and all the other videos are totally unrelated to the video I'm watching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: They're probably paid ads or something. <strong>That video thing is what's kind of happening on TikTok, is people are relating videos and responding on videos</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does bring me to another point. You said that in the old days, which was classic because you could just mean last year at this point, when we, again, when I found you, MySpace was still around, which, of course, went the way of the Dodo. And some people say Facebook's maybe on its way out, and even Instagram, people moving to TikTok, and maybe blogs are gone, and blah, blah, blah. We just can't keep up with all this stuff. It is not practical for authors to just keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm not going anywhere near TikTok. Just not doing it. And I don't blog anymore. I'm focused on podcasting. How do we know when to let something go? Because it's almost like that sunk cost fallacy. It's like, &#8216;Oh, but I've been building my platform here or doing this for a decade. I just don't want to give it up.' </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do we know when we need to give up one way of marketing and find another one?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: <strong>When it's not producing results</strong> is one of the best ways to know. If you're not selling books any longer through that particular platform or whatever you're doing, nobody's discovering you, nobody's emailing you, things like that, then you know that, &#8216;Okay. What I'm doing now isn't working.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a lot of friends that are in internet marketing, so I'm pretty in touch with people there, and one of the things they're telling me is that Facebook advertising isn't working anymore. Not like in the old days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there was a time when you could run a Facebook ad and you could sell a thousand of almost anything. It was like you were reaching out then, the Facebook ads were reaching people. But that's not really happening now. Not in the same way that it was. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't see as many ads when I go to visit Facebook as I used to. I'm not sure quite what Facebook is doing to make money, but I'm sure they're still making money. Even in Facebook, they're going more and more towards virtual spaces and Oculus and things like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will be a new frontier at some point, but I don't think there are very many authors who are selling books by tweeting. Twitter used to be a hot platform, but I don't hear about many authors who are actually selling books that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: For me, Twitter comes back to what you talked about at the beginning, which is connection. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my author friends are people I met on Twitter. Many of my paid speaking engagements have come from Twitter. Because Twitter is my number one social platform, that's what I focused on since 2009 when I joined. So, for me, it's the top of my funnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Hey, if it's still working, then you use it. I don't get any traffic from Twitter. I check my websites to see how people are coming to it. My top referral engine is the search engines. My second referral, and probably very close to being equal, and some days surpassing, is Pinterest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's interesting. I do use some Pinterest. Do you use it a lot, Pinterest?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: It depends on how you mean a lot. I pin probably three times a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: But <strong>if you know how to pin, if you know what to pin, you can get a lot of traffic through Pinterest</strong>. I created a course about Pinterest, &#8216;Real Fast Social Graphics,' that I partnered with Daniel Hall on. Most of the content is mine, but Daniel's got all the connections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talked about connecting with people. I use Daniel for that, because he loves doing that part of the promotion, and I love creating the content. So it's a great partnership. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Find a partnership</strong> like that for yourself. Somebody that loves doing some marketing aspect that you don't like to do, and you do the other part, and you guys work together, and you make a sale or something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm doing something now, coming up, I have a friend, Rudy Shur, he's a publisher at Square One Publishing. And he publishes a number of books on writing and marketing. So, he and I and a few other people are going to partner together to co-op market, market each other, market a book, put together a package, something like that. I think that's a great idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I think all authors should be connecting with other authors, and doing some sort of co-op marketing where you help each other.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: There are quite a lot of newsletter swaps, and blog tours, and that kind of thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I don't think blog tours work anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, I'm glad you said that. I completely agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: <strong>I think a podcast tour could work</strong>. In other words, you connect with 5 or 10 key podcasts, people who are podcasting in your area, and I would probably approach those podcasters by first saying, &#8216;I'd like to interview you,' which is what I did with you, and then you said, &#8216;Well, I want to interview you.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it doesn't always happen that they come out right away and say, &#8216;Well, let's interview each other.' But once you do an interview with somebody, let's say you interview them, and they had a great time, there's a very good chance that they're going to come back and say, &#8216;Hey, I want to interview you for my podcast.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Again, that's about that connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to email, because I signed up for your Substack — <a href=\"https://bookmarketing.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://bookmarketing.substack.com/</a>  —&nbsp; and I feel like one of the principles that I guess we've often had with marketing is it's better to own your own email list, it's better to control your platform, and what if they change the terms and all this. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What made you use Substack, and what's your email marketing principle at the moment?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Subststack.com is a free platform. It doesn't cost anything. You can build up a list of 10,000 people, and they will email for you for free. So, it's a no-brainer to me, because they make their money when you upgrade people to a paid version of your newsletter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Substack, I have a free newsletter that goes out to thousands of people, and that's free. At least a couple times a week, I'll send out something free. But then I also upgrade them to the paid version and in the paid version, that's where I'm teaching people a lot of the inside secrets that take a little bit longer to get into. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you want that inside secrets, if you want my course on how to use Substack to market your books, and how to use podcasting to market your books, you pay me. You sign up for the paid version of the newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's all run through Substack. <strong>The neat thing is that Substack, besides that email capability, and the paid version, which is like a membership site, they also offer podcasting.</strong> So you can do your podcasting on Substack, for free. No charge, and it's up and running, and you can syndicate it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They help you get connected with a number of top platforms. I think they do Apple Podcasts, and I think they do Spotify. I forget right now. I'm just working on that lesson now. But they help you connect with at least five of the top podcasting syndication services, the ones that will help get you the exposure you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Substack, it's all free, because <strong>they make their money on taking a piece of the action when you upgrade people to your paid newsletter</strong>. And, everybody, I don't care what kind of author you are, whether it's fiction or whatever, there's always an opportunity to upgrade people to a paid version of your newsletter, where they get insider tips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you're writing a novel, I guarantee you that if you're writing fiction and you have three or four books in that fiction series, there are people that are going to want to connect with you personally, and you can connect to them in an insider's club on Substack, where they pay you, say, $30 a year or $5 a month, something like that, and they get special emails from you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They get the opportunity to maybe meet you somewhere, or a Zoom session with you, or whatever it might be, that it's an upgrade. You can do this if you're writing memoirs, children's books, it doesn't matter. <strong>People want to make connections with you. </strong>The guy that wrote&#8230;I think it was Andy Weir. I think that was his name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah. Wrote <em>The Martian</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: He started podcasting his book as he was writing it. He got 80,000 people listening to his podcast because he was writing his book, and he said, &#8216;Well, I'll just podcast it. I'll read it out as I'm writing it.' And he built up such an audience that they said, &#8216;Andy, you gotta write a book.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Note from Joanna: <a href=\"https://www.wpr.org/author-discusses-how-martian-went-blog-blockbuster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Andy Weir blogged his book, not podcasted it</a>. But the same principle applies!]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because at the time, he was just podcasting some thoughts and ideas, initially, and then he started writing the book and podcasting that. He built up the 80,000 readers. They all wanted his book when it was ready to come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. He did really well. And a lot of people use Patreon, including me, which does email people who support you, and I put extra audio and things on there. It's interesting how many of these other options there are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to ask you about this, because, of course, you have built essentially a non-fiction business around one key book, and then obviously, you have tons of other books, and products, and courses, and things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wondered if you'd talk about what are these multiple streams of income. Because many people think, &#8216;Oh, I just have to make my income from book sales.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that's not true, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>John: The most successful authors don't make all their money just from book sales. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They're making it by going out and speaking, and getting paid for speaking, if you're nonfiction. If they're fiction, they're probably selling the rights to their book to make a movie out of, like <em>The Martian</em>, or the kid's book series from the British author.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Harry Potter has his own theme park, for goodness sake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: Well, I mean, she became a billionaire, not from selling books. She would've been a millionaire from selling books. She became a billionaire by selling the rights to the movies. And there's a lot of that you can do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, <strong>for a lot of authors, the best thing you could do is to create some sort of course built around your book</strong>. If you're a fiction author, people that read fiction, almost all of them dream at some point about writing a book themselves. So, if nothing else, if you're a fiction author, you could teach people how to publish and become successful with doing a fiction book. You did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: You could just take them through the steps of what you did, in terms of marketing your book, and go from there. Children's book authors, the same way. Almost every adult that reads children's books dreams of writing one themselves. And almost everybody has a book inside them of some sort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's one reason that part of my content that I do in some of my websites has nothing to do with marketing or books in general. It's just a way of attracting people to my website, so they can discover, because <strong>I believe almost everybody has a book inside them.</strong> So the world is my audience for how to market a book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, obviously, not everybody's going to be interested in that, but at some point, I think a lot of people really do dream of writing a book. And why not capture that as soon as you can?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing is that a lot of people have discovered my marketing information through the information that I share on&#8230; I have a sort of a hobby website called myincrediblewebsite.com. I started out that website just to use it as an example when I was doing a course on how to market online and how to create a website. So I created a website, I made videos about it. I called it &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.myincrediblewebsite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">My Incredible Website</a>.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, I loved having it, because it's like my hobby website. Everything that doesn't fit into book marketing, I throw on that website. I have a whole section on how to pray, and I'm writing several books on that topic coming up. I share my other hobbies, like, I love TV series, so I actually have a whole set of pages on that website about where TV series are set. Are they in Texas? Are they in Missouri? Are they in Michigan? Things like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just fascinates me how people will create a TV series. They're built around a strange town in Washington state, or Oregon, or whatever. So I started collecting that information. I'm a packrat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: We're almost out of time, but I do want to ask you about this, because if anyone goes to <strong>your websites, they are absolutely packed with content</strong>. And as you've talked about, <strong>you learn something, and you turn it into an article, or a course, or another email, or a book, and even your hobbies, you're turning into other things</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm the same. I started a second podcast, &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel</a>,' because I love walking and travel and that kind of thing. We take something, we learn something, and we turn it into something else, like the kind of creative thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm in awe of your productivity. How do you manage your time? And this is also a question about marketing. One of the things that people say is, &#8216;Well, how do I balance my time?' Do you have any productivity tips, since you are incredibly productive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: I am, but that's just because I'm persistent. I'm actually ADHD in some way. I just jump from one thing to another. It's hard for me to stay focused sometimes and end up finishing a book. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The key thing is, if you're going to do marketing, do at least one thing a day. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do one thing a day, whether it's send out an email, do a podcast episode, get interviewed by somebody else, over time, that's 365 action items a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If any of them are even targeted a little bit towards reaching out to the audience you want to reach out to, you're going to start to get noticed. <strong>Most authors give up marketing after about two weeks.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing is, is that you have to do something every day, for every book that you wrote and love. Ideally, at some point, you find somebody that's even better at marketing your books than you are. For me, that was Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen. They loved my book, &#8216;1001 Ways.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack actually has a video where he talks about putting my entire book up on the wall, basically the ideas, and then acting on them, and taking them down as he acted on those ideas. He did five things a day. Most of the time, it was being interviewed or something like that, or reaching out to people that could interview him, because, of course, <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em> was a wonderful interview subject because all he had to do is tell one of the stories and people would be bawling on the other side of the line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I heard Jack and Mark speak and they told a story from <em>Chicken Soup for the Soul</em>, the first book, I had tears streaming down my face. I just let it out. It was such a moving story, and it did make me cry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And look at that franchise now. That franchise is a juggernaut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John: They've actually, almost close to 800 million books, and I think they're moving up towards a billion. And the thing is that they did what they loved doing. And it was really interesting because they told me, &#8216;We sent it out to 250 publishers and they all rejected us.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The publishers believed that short stories don't sell. <strong>But what the publishers didn't understand is that book was backed by 100 professional speakers. </strong>And every one of those speakers had a stake in that book being a success. And boy, it wasn't just Jack and Mark marketing that book. It was 100 speakers, professional speakers, getting out there and saying, &#8216;This is an incredible book. You should buy it.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. Right. Well, we could talk all day, but we're out of time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and your books and courses and everything you do online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>John: At <a href=\"https://bookmarketingbestsellers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bookmarketingbestsellers.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant.

So welcome back to the show, J.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Thanks, Joanna. I'm excited to be back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm excited to talk to you. So you and I talk about this topic offline away from the mic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes, quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I mean, amazingly, we actually have conversations away from a microphone. People might not believe it but we do. So let's start with the basics. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you explain NFTs to a non-technical audience?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Not well! But I just read something today that I think really crystallized it for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An NFT is proof of ownership.</strong> That's all it is. It's a receipt. And I think when you frame it that way, things start to make a lot more sense. So it's not necessarily a physical object. It's not necessarily even a digital object. It's proof of ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that's one good way of explaining it. <strong>I talk about it as like a box. A box that you can put stuff in</strong>, and we'll be talking about some of the examples of the stuff you can put in the box. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the NFT is essentially like the receipt showing you have access to the box, and then there are <strong>all the different kinds of things we can put in a box</strong>. I guess we should also say it is programmable in some way. So when you say a receipt, I might think in my mind, just a one-liner, which says, &#8216;I paid J some money and he edited my book,' or whatever. And that's like a one-liner. Whereas NFTs can contain, let's just use the word, smart contract which makes it more programmable, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. It's <strong>an immutable digital ledger that is spread across many different computers.</strong> We'll leave out the highly technical stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea is with an NFT, from the time it's created or minted for its entire lifespan, you can track who's owned it and when by the address of the wallet of the owner. So yes, it's much more detailed than a single-line receipt, and it does contain the history of that particular NFT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And then I guess we have to use the term blockchain. But, again, as we always say, <strong>you don't need to know how the internet works to use the internet.</strong> So you don't need to know all this technical stuff. It's the same with blockchain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what's most interesting at this point is <strong>NFTs can be on different blockchains. And the different blockchains have different properties associated with them</strong>. And I feel like some objections to blockchain technologies are because people have only heard of certain blockchains like Bitcoin. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what are some of the other blockchains that you've seen that you think are more interesting?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Well, I think from an author's perspective, I'm not entirely interested in Bitcoin simply because Bitcoin is more like stored value. It's the digital equivalent to gold. So you can hold gold and it has value, and you can sell it. But people don't really use gold to pay for things. And in much the same way, they don't really use Bitcoin transactionally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think for me, the next big one is <strong>Ethereum or Eth. And that one is the biggest blockchain right now as far as transactions go, especially with NFTs.</strong> But there are certain other side chains and level twos. And again, don't worry about the terminology. But there are blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Tezos. These are all <strong>different blockchains with different currencies that are popping up and filling different niches in the blockchain world</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And that's where some of them are dealing with the carbon thing, and we'll come back on the environmental topic which I know some people just have it in their heads. So we'll come back on that one. And they also have <strong>different fees for different transactions</strong>. So all of this stuff is just evidence of growth in a new industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But let's also be clear on what NFTs are NOT as it relates to intellectual property.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. I don't know if people are familiar with what happened with the &#8216;Dune' book, but it was auctioned, I believe, at Christie's. And the intention was SpiceDAO was going to turn it into an NFT project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their assumption, incorrectly, was that they owned copyright, or that they owned the IP to create derivatives or to change it. And there was a <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptobros-spend-millions-rare-jodorowsky-dune-book-copyright-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">great article on The Next Web </a>that said that would be the equivalent of saying you bought a Jar Jar Binks toy and now you have the right to make a new &#8216;Star Wars' movie starring Jar Jar Binks. It doesn't work that way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so really, you do not own the intellectual property, you cannot create in it or on it. Think of it more as a work of art. So if you go to a gallery and you purchase a painting, you own that painting but you don't own the intellectual property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Just to put it on the book perspective, just on a really basic level, <strong>someone goes into a secondhand bookstore and they buy a secondhand copy of your book. So they own that book and they can resell that book, but they don't own the intellectual property of that book</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can't scan it, turn it into a Kindle book, and upload it onto Amazon and make money from it, or make a movie of it. So it's essentially exactly the same as the physical world as such, if they had bought a physical book, and then they just assumed they had this right to do stuff with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you also mentioned the DAO which we should just explain briefly. <strong>DAO stands for a decentralized autonomous organization.</strong> And I'm thinking about it as a collective of people who come together and you can, again, programmable ways of running an organization. Let's not go into that because I'm going to have a separate episode on DAOs. I think they're incredibly interesting from a legal and business perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for now, we're gonna stick with NFTs. So just to be very clear,<strong> copyright is not assumed in an NFT unless that is specified. </strong>And of course, I had someone on the show last year who talked about the communities of authors who are trying to grant copyright within a community, a bit like the Kindle world, where the author who wrote in that got the copyright over their book within the world, but not over the whole world. [<a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/10/29/the-ownership-economy-business-models-around-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Ownership Model with Jessica Artemisia in episode 561</a>.] Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It certainly does. That's a good way of explaining it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: So hopefully, that's given a bit of an overview and people who are new to this topic. Let's get into some more details. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why are you so excited about NFTs and blockchain for authors? And what are some of the benefits you can see in the years ahead?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. This is crazy stuff. I want to say, first of all, we are not tax professionals. We are not financial advisors. I'm barely scratching the surface of what Web 3 is. I'm an author who's really interested in this. So everything I'm going to say is not necessarily grounded in a ton of experience or research. It's my experience so far. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I'm really excited about at the highest level, <strong>because of where I was in my life stage in the early to mid-'90s, I feel like I missed out on the internet. Like the internet boom, right?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, if you think about what happened between, say, 1994 to 1999, there was an explosion of Web 1, starting to go into Web 2 with blogging and eventually, podcasting. And I was completely tied up in my day job and my family. And I knew what was happening but I wasn't really paying close attention to it. I wasn't participating in it. And this feels like that, and now I feel like I have the opportunity to participate. So I think on a very grand scale, I'm excited about a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have strong suspicions and feelings that <strong>Web 3, crypto, blockchain, all the stuff we're talking about is going to radically transform our lives</strong>, <strong>whether or not we understand the technology, in much the same way the internet has</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Those of us in our mid-40s, 50s, started to hear really about the internet in the late 90s. I mean, I didn't get an email until I think '95, you know, an email address. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we're talking about <strong>Web 1, we're really talking about static websites</strong> where it's like, you can't do anything. It was just like the Yellow Pages online (if you remember the Yellow Pages!). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Web 2 is the more interactive internet, blogging, podcasting, social media</strong>. I mean, what we're in now is still kind of the end-stage of Web 2, e-commerce, that type of thing on more interactive websites, creator, content, posted social media, that kind of thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Web 3 is what we're seeing with the metaverse, blockchain, converging technologies with AI,</strong> different ways of doing things that will empower the creative economy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what specifically for authors are you excited about in terms of, I guess, the creative or business potential of NFTs?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I think you're correct in saying potential, that is the right word. So what I'm going to discuss is not necessarily something that we can start right now, although the technology's there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what really has me excited about, specifically, <strong>NFTs for authors, is it's a paradigm shift</strong>. We are going to have the ability to sell directly to fans and readers to create communities directly without any sort of middle entity, without a marketplace. And I know we can do this now in selling direct, but I think here's the takeaway like, if this is all Greek to you or you don't understand what we're talking about, this is at its core where I think it's going to<strong> fundamentally change the way authors sell and do business is the digital resale</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So with NFTs and with the way you can structure a smart contract, an author can get paid on the resale of anything, whether that's a physical book or a digital book. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think about that, you think about like, if you sell a paperback and someone who bought your paperback goes and sells it to a used bookstore, and someone else comes in and buys that book from the used bookstore, you as the author receive zero from that. But <strong>imagine, in perpetuity, you as the author receive 10% of that resell forever</strong>. I think that's just a radical idea that's going to completely change the way we do business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And that's why I think so many people haven't got this yet because it hasn't happened before. The penny hasn't dropped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the publishing industry and some of the things I've seen online from agents and publishers who&#8230; Well, I guess, this is another difference, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You and I (and the listeners) are creators. We create Intellectual Property. We are the Creator Economy. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And so everything we put out into the world with our name on it that we own the IP for, we get money for some kind of licensing on that. And <strong>it's all funded by what we actually make</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas people who work in the publishing industry, generally get a salary that is not related to the licensing of their own IP. So I feel like sometimes people aren't understanding this because they aren't actually creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I'm very excited about the same reason as you because resale opens up for the life of copyright. Okay, this is what's so exciting with a programmable smart contract. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I create an NFT now and someone buys it for, let's say, $250. And, you know, that's nice. But what then happens is <strong>they can resell that over time and I get a percentage of that resale</strong>. So they could sell it next year, and maybe because I'm such a prolific creator, the value has gone up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe it's now worth $400 and I get 10% of that. So I get like 40 bucks, just turns up in my wallet. And then I do something and I manage to hit some list or I win an award, and <strong>suddenly the value of my IP is worth more</strong>. So my trading value on of my NFTs goes up too. And maybe I've created more limited editions of things. And so the value of my intellectual property suddenly just expands into this incredible realm. That's why I'm excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. It's funny you used that example of winning awards or having a breakout hit, where I was thinking like, I'll probably say something stupid or get arrested, and that'll make the value of mine go up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah, but there is that, you just don't know. I mean, the funny thing is I really feel like right now, this is fiction particularly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fiction business model right now, I feel, is almost broken because the rise of subscription models for ebooks and digital audio are tending the income for fiction digital products down. It's sloping down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yes, sure there's print on demand. But many indies make far more with digital products for fiction, in particular. This doesn't count with nonfiction because nonfiction is, I think, far more resilient. And then you've got ads, the fact that we have to pay for ads. So I've been feeling for a while, like, frustrated that our business model just can't last another decade. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But this to me feels like the pivot, it feels like with special editions — let's call them special digital editions NFTs — we are suddenly going to explode and expand the fiction possibilities and the fiction business model. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with collaboration. Like you and I, right, we still have to fanny around with paying each other for various projects. You know, whereas if we had smart contracts, the money just arrives in your account, in your wallet automatically. So it <strong>opens up the potential for collaboration</strong> and so much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Totally agree. And I think this is probably going to bridge into the conversation around NFTs in the nonfiction space. But I think there are some <strong>opportunities in fiction that can build upon habits and behaviors we already have, and leverage the power of the technology</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here's a very rudimentary example. Let's say that you as a fiction author offer a book club to your core readers. And let's say, you and 20 readers are going to get together and you're going to hold a book club meeting. And those people are coming to that because they're drawn to you, they want to support you. So imagine now that you sell an NFT that is your seat in this book club. And now you own that seat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as time goes on, if you want to sell it to someone else, you can. And as you mentioned, if your stock as an author goes up, or if you become more in demand, or your time was more limited, the perceived value on that book club seat grows as well. So it's just one small example of the way I think NFTs have the potential to really change the way fiction authors sell and market too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, let's get into that question then. So if the NFT unlocks a digital box of things, let's talk about those different things. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So you just mentioned access to a book club through an NFT. Talk about that in your idea for nonfiction-based community and masterminds?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. So I'm currently in what I'm calling an NFT beta phase where I have a small subset of people within my author community who&#8230;they raised their hand and said they want to be part of this. And we don't have it all figured out yet, but we are in the middle of figuring out, okay, how can we create this subgroup, this smaller group that has access? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the problems with NFTs right now is that the lingo and the tech bros who are talking about this stuff are using <strong>language that excludes the average person because they feel stupid, like, they don't know what they're talking about</strong>. That's always bothered me with technology and it's still here, but, you know, it's not that complicated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <strong>having the ability to create access is different than buying a JPEG</strong>. So if you look at the news stories, all the news stories around, you know, &#8216;Someone paid $69 million for this JPEG, why would they do that?' And a JPEG is one type of NFT. It's probably the most popular one. But as you mentioned, if you think about it more as a digital box, you can put anything in there. Like Gary Vaynerchuk is doing really innovative stuff with his NFTs [<a href=\"https://veefriends.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Veefriends</a>] that includes access to him, attendance at physical live events, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So the sky's the limit here as far as what you can put into that digital box.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. So I guess what you're talking about there is the idea of a community coin which you and I are in some other kind of futurist communities around this, and if you buy one of these tokens or an NFT that can represent a ticket to something, then it gives you access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was talking to a friend of mine who is a coach. And he was kind of struggling to understand this potential for his business model. And I was telling him about <strong>the NFT smart contract doesn't have to be for the life of copyright. It doesn't have to be a product.</strong> We'll circle back to products in a minute. It can be a service, like you're saying, it could be access to a community. And I said to him, &#8216;Well, it could be access to six months coaching.' So someone buys the token upfront.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I said, &#8216;What is awesome is this functionality called airdropping,' right? So <strong>you airdrop extra special things to anyone holding a token of yours</strong>. So maybe you've done a special audio that goes out to everyone holding your token, or maybe you've commissioned some art to go with your project, or maybe you just do something special which you can then airdrop to anyone holding one of your tokens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were talking about the <strong>benefits for your long-term kind of client maintenance</strong> <strong>and brand-building</strong> of being able to send something, it's like, &#8216;Surprise, here's an awesome extra for you,' or you know, a lesson on something if it's nonfiction, or if it's fiction, a bonus chapter or something. And then it arrives in people's wallet. And it almost, I don't want to say it replaces email, but <strong>it becomes this way to deliver surprising delightful things to an audience who have already invested in you</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Absolutely. And as you mentioned, <strong>it doesn't have to be something that lasts forever. You can almost think of an NFT as an enhanced concert ticket</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let's say a musician wants to put on a show and much like on a Patreon or Kickstarter, they create several tiers of access, and you purchase the NFT for whatever level of access you want. And once you've purchased that NFT, everything else is controlled by the program. So you could scan the NFT, you could sell it to someone else, you could trade it, the NFT knows where you're supposed to be, and where you're not. And especially in a digital world, <strong>I can fully imagine NFTs or tokens of some kind replacing membership software.</strong> If your membership site can read the address in your wallet, knows you belong there, you're just in. You don't need a password. You don't need to register. It's all automated, and I think there's a lot of potential there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah, absolutely. Well, let's talk about some of the other things you might do. So you're, obviously, incredibly great at communities. That's one of your superpowers, and it's not one of mine. And so I am far more interested in&#8230; I think even my dad's a visual artist. He was a sculptor and now he's a printmaker, and my brother's a photographer, and <strong>we come from a more of a visual arts family</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I am also starting to create art around my worlds with AI generation tools, which is a whole &#8216;nother podcast! But I feel like for me, the business model I'm interested in is what I mentioned before, which is <strong>creating NFTs of limited digital editions</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, with the short story, I just put out, <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/blood-sweat-and-flame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blood, Sweat, and Flame</a>, which is set in the glassblowing world. That's just a short story, right? But the ideas I have for the NFTs I could do around that short story just opened the world up to other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/blood-sweat-and-flame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-1024x536.png\" alt=\"Blood Sweat Flame\" class=\"wp-image-33943\" width=\"544\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-1024x536.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-300x157.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-768x402.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So a collaboration with an artist, or making my own art, for example, or creating a postscript on the story of what happened next, or collaborating with a glass artist to do a video. There's lots of things I can do to make a limited edition version of these books. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Now, in my mind, these are all individually different. So I only see myself doing like three or five, or maybe even 10 individual NFTs for each book. And that would be like a collection. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the collection would be per book, and each one would be different. So even like, superfans might buy more than one because they love whatever it is that I've included. And then over time, <strong>my collections will grow and grow around the IP that I have in my universes</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to me, <strong>this is making me feel so much more creative because I've got so many ideas that suddenly become viable within this space</strong>. And I know lots of fiction authors who've already commissioned art and things like this that they could include in NFT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I wish I had more hours in the day, Joanna, because I'm like you. I can honestly say that the whole <strong>NFT craze of 2021 was the sole reason I started picking up my guitar again</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hadn't taken my guitar out of its case for years, and I started to see what was happening and I thought, &#8216;Wow, music is another great place.' So you mentioned the graphic arts, which is clearly a wonderful opportunity. And the same with the visual and the auditory arts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if you're a musician and <strong>you have the ability to create original music, you could tie that to your fiction to different stories</strong>. And I'm actively working on writing some music now that I think will tie into several things that I'm working on. And I don't need a major record label, I don't need to go through Spotify. These are things that my audience might be interested in, and I can sell directly to them. So I agree with you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I'm so excited. It's really restoked a lot of my creative fire outside of just the writing and publishing.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Awesome. I'm so happy to hear that. I hope people listening can hear our excitement. And I do feel like we're pretty, let's say, &#8216;mature' in the indie space. We've been around the block a few times in the indie world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it can become a little bit sort of, &#8216;Yes, I know how to write a book now, I know how to sell a book, I know how to market a book, and I'll just do it again.' And yes, every book is interesting in its way. But <strong>there's so much more that we want to do with the ideas. And this finally gives us a chance to do it.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do want to ask about another example, which you forwarded to me earlier, about royalty rights to songs. Now, this could also apply to books. So talk about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: This is fascinating. And I'm not surprised it's happening in the music industry because artists in that industry have been exploited for a long time. And I think they see Web 3.0 as an opportunity to gain back some of their rights and their IP and their revenue, quite frankly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>NAS, big-time rapper, is selling royalty rights to two of his songs through NFTs. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is on a platform called <a href=\"https://royal.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">royal.io</a> and it's brand new. So there's not much there yet. But just to give you a sense of what's possible. [<a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/nas-to-sell-royalty-rights-to-two-of-his-songs-as-nfts-3133351\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Full article on NME here</a>.]He's creating tokens around one song. He created three levels, the gold, the platinum, and the diamond. At the gold level, which is $50, so you pay $50 And you get access to his Discord and you get some sort of&#8230;he calls it a sweet chick secret menu. I don't know what that is but it must be valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Sounds cool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. And you also get <strong>0.143% ownership of his streaming royalties on that song. So when that song is played, you're going to share in that revenue.</strong> On the platinum level, it's $250 to buy in. You get everything with gold, plus you get exclusive merch, and in that you get the 0.857% of streaming royalties. And then the top tier of the diamond, you get everything for gold and platinum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also get two VIP concert tickets, exclusive signed vinyl, a video conversation with him, and 2.14% of streaming royalties, and that package costs $5,000. So you can already see how artists are empowering&#8230;not only empowering their audience, they're bringing them along. And I think this is again, one of those fundamental differences. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You're not only supporting the artists but you are benefiting from their success. Everybody wins in this situation.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: There's a few things out of this. First of all, <strong>you've got baked in marketing for everyone who buys a token because everyone is incentivized to go stream NAS on whatever platform</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, as we know, if you send traffic and get more people streaming, the algorithms like it, and they bump you up. So if you get all those token holders streaming and telling their friends, &#8216;Hey, stream NAS this weekend at your party or whatever,' you get baked in marketing which is brilliant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, this is, I believe, is called <strong>fractionalization where you're essentially splitting this into micropayments</strong>, and <strong>this is exactly what we need in the publishing space</strong>. And just for something that people ask me all the time, I get so many emails, and I wanted to do this too with my first book, which is I want to give 10% of my profits to charity. How do I do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those ways. <strong>You could put in your smart contract a 10% fraction that goes directly to a charity's digital wallet</strong> if they set one up, that's another way of looking at it. But I think that's amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love Royal, the CEO is <a href=\"https://3lau.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3LAU</a>; I think you pronounce his name, Blau, 3-L-A-U. He is the one who got me into this. About a year ago, I heard him speak at a conference, online, obviously, because of the pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>And when he spoke about blockchain and music, I saw our future because he's a creator, he is an artist. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And he's not well known as far as I know in the normal world. But he just ran with blockchain early, and the guy is just doing so well. And obviously now what he started, Royal, and this is probably going to be billions of dollars for him now because <strong>he's done the architecture for other musicians</strong>. So yeah, that's amazing, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It is. And it's very easy to just say, &#8216;Okay, substitute a novel for song,' right? Like, we can take the same structure and this is <strong>what I'm working on right now, is I want to be able to fractionalize the royalties from my books</strong>, and I want to be able to give 0.5% or 1% to hundreds, you know&#8230;well, not hundreds, I can't do the math there. But <strong>I want to be able to fractionalize and give percentages or parts of percentages of royalties to readers because now they're incentivized to, as you said, market the book, and everybody wins</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the book sells, I make money and they make money. And it works all the way around. So the fact that this structure is already in place, that <strong>there are artists, creatives who are doing this, it's just a matter of time before it comes to us</strong>. And I can't wait for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I agree. And this is another kind of <strong>principle of Web 3, right? So you're rewarded for participation in a community.</strong> So whereas like at the moment, you're on Twitter, and I like, &#8216;Oh, you know, J's my friend, I really want to support him. I'll tweet here about his book or whatever.' And then that's helping in a way. In the future, we'll be able to help each other or support the creators we love by buying tokens, we support them, we also get a cut. So that's really amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now social networks on blockchain where you get rewarded for participation, and you get coins for what your participation is. There is obviously gaming, play to earn, I think it's called where you can play games on blockchain and earn coin, and there are people making full-time livings from this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Check out this <a href=\"https://yaro.blog/32703/web3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introductory article on Web 3 by Yaro Starak</a>. It has examples of all these different kinds of participatory platforms.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is not the future anymore, is it? It's kind of right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, it's not. And I'm not a gamer so I don't know the world. But I do know that NFTs and <strong>tokenization of gaming is probably what's gonna be the gasoline on the fire here</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the big companies get behind this, or once there are some indies who start understanding how blockchain works, because this is the kind of thing that's been happening with traditional currency for years. I mean, kids were, you know, in &#8216;Roblox' or &#8216;Minecraft,' or whatever you want to call it, they're going in there buying digital weapons and digital outfits, and this is already happening. So there's no stopping it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And we should say, you mentioned there, big companies. I mean, <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft just bought a massive gaming company</a> which you guys covered on the &#8216;Writers, Ink,' which was great. But also I've seen news articles that <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/youtube-cryptocurrency-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube's looking at NFTs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893502/nft-twitter-profile-picture-crypto-wallet-opensea-coinbase-right-click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter is looking at incorporating NFTs</a>. Facebook/Meta is looking at NFTs [<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Financial Times</a>]. And when these big companies are looking at it, that's when it will go more mainstream. I mean, let's just be clear, I have not bought an NFT. I am excited as a creator. There is a creator I really love but his work has already like blown up massively. But you have bought one. Tell us about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>J: I've purchased a few NFTs but the one I'm really excited about is called ZIGGURAT. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And the <a href=\"https://ziggurats.xyz/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ZIGGURAT</a> was created by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park. And he calls it a generative mixtape. So what he did is he created, I think it was 8,000 or 9,000 NFTs. And what he did was, they're a <strong>combination of a profile picture style graphic and music</strong>. And he created different characteristics, different variables. So everything from hair color to eye color to facial expressions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the music track, there were 10 or 15 different drum beats, different melodies, different instrumentation. So he created all of these core building blocks, so to speak, of both the graphic image and the audio. And then he fed that into an AI. And the <strong>AI then kicked out 8,000 unique NFTs. So no two are the same</strong>. Now they might share certain attributes, but every single one of those is unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I heard about this, I just thought that sounds like the coolest thing ever. And I went, and <strong>on the day it dropped it sold out instantly.</strong> It's on the Tezos blockchain. So I ended up buying one of the secondary market. I think the original minting, it was the equivalent of about $75. And when I bought it, it was maybe $110, so it cost me a little bit more. But I have one now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>And it's so creative and it's so unique. And I thought if I'm going to get into the space, I need to know what it feels like to be a fan, to be a consumer. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kind of got that experience and it was really fun. And people are tired of hearing me talk about it because I share it everywhere, but it was a great example of being super creative and using the technology in a way that hadn't been done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And it's funny because you talked about it, I was like, &#8216;Oh yeah, I used to listen to Linkin Park back in the day, put them on the Spotify playlist, revisiting like, '90s when I used to listen to these things.' So I think it's really interesting. And what you've done there is <strong>you're a fan of the music, you know that creator</strong>. I mean, he has name recognition amongst certain people, obviously, but you're a fan. So that's a great example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That generative mixtape idea, I actually did a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaCgydeMu64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one-hour tutorial on how to do that at the weekend</a>. And it was for the visual ones. And I mean, I'm not a programmer, but this guy really kind of took it from even if you don't know programming you can do this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is kind of a sub-question though because I've been into AI generative work for a while now and words, as well as images, and you're talking about music there, but you were not that much of a fan of AI art generation a year ago. So has that changed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, it hasn't. I knew you were gonna put me on the spot on this, I was prepared. This might be semantics and maybe I just need to get over myself, but I think the difference here is that Mike didn't use AI to create the components, he used it to assemble them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: But that's what I do, I assemble. I put the input in and I assemble what comes out. So yes, I think it is semantics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, it's been going around in the art space, the <a href=\"https://app.wombo.art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WOMBO Dream app</a>. Rachael Herron put some of her pictures. Get the app or get it on your desktop. And what I'm doing with that is I'm <strong>creating like word clouds separately from my novels. And then you create images with AI from a string of words.</strong> <strong>So you enter the words and then it outputs a unique image based on your words.</strong> So your words will always be different to my words. And, essentially they're going to have a minting button soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"450\" height=\"731\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Generative-art-created-by-words-from-J.F.-Penns-Stone-of-Fire-input-into-Wombo-Dream-app.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33944\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Generative-art-created-by-words-from-J.F.-Penns-Stone-of-Fire-input-into-Wombo-Dream-app.png 450w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Generative-art-created-by-words-from-J.F.-Penns-Stone-of-Fire-input-into-Wombo-Dream-app-185x300.png 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /><figcaption>AI Generative art created by words from J.F. Penn's Stone of Fire and Wombo Dream app, Jan 2022</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I love this idea that I can take my words and turn them into visual art. And in the same way, there's obviously now AI generative music which is another art form. So I mean, this is a sub-topic. We're going to come back on this sub-topic, I think. But that's just on a practical level. For someone to create 9,000, 10,000 individual NFTs, you have to have some help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Because I said before <strong>if I do 3 or 5 or 10 because I'm going to individually make them, which is different. I can assemble those separately. I don't need an AI to help me create them.</strong> So I think people have to consider what kind of collections they want to do, what kind of audience they're looking for. I mean, you wouldn't do 10,000 community tokens, would you, I guess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No. And I mean, even going back to Royal, like, there were only&#8230;I think there were only a total of 750 tokens, 760 tokens total. So yeah, it doesn't have to be a crypto punks or a massive collection, you can make one of ones. And I think that's more of what you're talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I think, again, that's because I guess what I've seen my dad do as a visual artist. And it's so funny. And <strong>one of my phrases for this year is &#8220;more digital, more physical.&#8221;</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as in, I want to get more into all this digital stuff but I also want to do more physical stuff. So I did a bookbinding course years ago, but I'm going on another one. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I want to make physical products too. I want to make limited edition physical products. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on my <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JFPenn.com</a> redesigned website, which I'm going to do later this year, it will have limited editions as a page. And on that page, it will have <strong>limited physical editions and limited NFT editions</strong>. That's how I want to educate people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I love that. And I'm thinking along the same lines with music and thinking of doing the digital files, obviously, but maybe a limited press vinyl, or a limited number of CDs. And so in the physical world, as well as in the digital world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: There you go. And I hope&#8230;that kind of crosses the gap, doesn't it? These are limited editions. But equally with those physical products, once they're sold, they're gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: They are gone. So you're never gonna get any more money for that. But I just like the idea. I think that's cool. Okay, anything else on any ideas? So look, and this is just off the top of our heads and we haven't even started yet. I mean, <strong>you can put video in, you can do audio, obviously, I'm going to do scans of my hand edits</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the partnership idea with other artists. In the past, we've obviously done written products together like <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/risengods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Risen Gods</a>, but you can do an NFT for an audio-only product, like a private conversation between Joanna Penn and J. Thorne. There are lots of things you can do that people will be interested in if they're in your community, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Absolutely. And as we said with the whole smart contract thing, it doesn't require us finagling around and doing all the accounting. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In the smart contract, we put ourselves as co-creators and our percentages, and then anytime that sells, it just ends up in our wallet.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah. So I guess both of us are&#8230;I mean, you're more heavily into the music space, I'm probably more heavily into the art space. But <strong>we're watching these communities who are ahead of us like, they're ahead of publishing. And music's always like two to five years ahead</strong>, would you say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It feels that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: So I would say we've probably got at least another year before we get a platform that works for authors. Well, let's talk about platforms. Okay. So everyone's now really excited now — if they haven't turned off already!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: The people who are here are loving it, though!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: They are like, &#8216;Yeah, tell us more. Tell us more. How can I do one?' Okay, so hold up, hold your horses. We're recording this on the 26th of January, 2022. We're going to probably do another one of these in a couple of months, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It will all change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: <strong>It'll all change. But the principles should remain.</strong> So there are <strong>different companies emerging with different business models for NFTs in publishing</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I do see some early adopters jumping in. I've had some people on my podcast like <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/11/05/creatokia-digital-originals-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Creatokia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/03/12/blockchain-for-publishing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookchain</a>. I've got some meetings with some other people. You've had some meetings with some other people. There's already like 10 on my list already. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are your thoughts on any companies you want to mention and anything that you've seen is particularly interesting?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Well, the one I want to mention, and I'll be fully transparent and say that I'm a moderator on their Discord server, so I'm not getting compensated monetarily, but I'm definitely interested in what they're doing, is <a href=\"https://www.bookcoin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bookcoin.com</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of all of the NFT book sites that are popping up, I'm most intrigued by Book Coin, and for a number of reasons. If you go to bookcoin.com, I think <strong>their messaging is crystal clear, and they're trying to carve out a market</strong>. And right now, what their value proposition is, &#8220;own a quote, a character, or a chapter from your favorite book.&#8221; And their first drop is going to be next month in February of 2022. And it's gonna be Mark Manson's book and a New York Times' bestseller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: We should say that is &#8216;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***,' which I'm sure everyone's heard of. It was one of the first to use that language in a book title, and then everyone did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. And it was massive and is massively successful. Mark Manson just finished working with Will Smith on a memoir. But anyway, the Book Coin guys, they have Alan Watts and Alan Watts collection coming up after the Mark Manson drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I don't know who that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. He's a sort of 20th-century philosopher type, I guess would be the best way to describe him. But I think what Book Coin is doing is they're <strong>starting with name recognition. They're starting with authors that everyone knows as a way to bridge that gap</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that's an approach I really like because <strong>until they have a platform that's mature and developed, and that readers feel comfortable going to, indies or self-publishers have no hope of getting any discoverability</strong>. So I'm really interested in Book Coin. And as I said, I'm working for them as a moderator because I really believe in what they're doing. And that first drop comes next month. So I think things are gonna start rolling pretty fast there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Okay, that's interesting. Now, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/11/05/creatokia-digital-originals-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Creatokia who I had on the podcast in episode 583</a>, I've been talking to them about things and they're working with a lot of the publishing industry. They're a German company and they're very well known for their work in digital audio and ebooks within Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what's interesting about Creatokia, I guess is because their company is <a href=\"https://www.bookwire.de/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookwire</a>, they have a reputation in the publishing industry. They're also German and the EU has rules around crypto, around finances, around tax, I mean, the EU has a lot more stringent stuff. So why I'm interested in them is because <strong>I feel like they're going to do it in the right way</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can't get into it because we don't know ourselves, like, we have lots of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the financial implications? What are these for tax? Are they a product? Are they a service? Are they an asset? How does the tax work on the first sale? How does it work on the resale? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are things we don't know yet which is why I'm kind of holding off. So Creatokia is definitely looking at all these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also had <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/03/12/blockchain-for-publishing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookchain on last year, Simon-Pierre Marion in episode 538</a>, they're out of Canada. They're on the Ethereum blockchain and they're looking more at the infrastructure side, as in not really a marketplace. And then there's some other ones that we're both looking at. I'll put a list in the show notes for this episode of the companies that I know about right now. And over time, there were going to be more of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bookchain</li><li>Publica</li><li>Creatokia</li><li>Soltype</li><li>Readl</li><li>Bookcoin</li><li>Bookvolts</li><li>CryptoversalBooks</li><li>PageDAO</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we're waiting for one because there's no specific company that's ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>When I upload an NFT, I'm essentially creating a smart contract, that could last for a very long time. So it has to be right. It has to be automated. I have to know what it means financially. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is like signing a contract for the life of copyright if that's your&#8230;you know, if you haven't term-limited your NFT. So that's why I have some hesitation. What about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Same. <strong>I had intended on minting an NFT by now, but the platforms just aren't ready yet</strong>. <strong>And like you said, there are just too many unanswered questions</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have one friend who has a marketplace on the Solana blockchain and I had a great conversation with him. But even he still isn't sure about a lot of this. I think this goes back to&#8230; I'm making a broad generalization here, but it'll make a point. You mentioned earlier that we are much more interested as creators because we're the ones creating the IP. I feel like <strong>some of the people who are building the marketplaces or building the infrastructure, they don't see that same risk because they're not putting their IP out there. They're getting paid to build it.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in some of these conversations I've had, there's this sort of, &#8216;Oh, yeah, we'll figure that out.' And I'm like, &#8216;No, we need to figure that out first.' Like, we can't just put stuff up there and figure it out later. But again, <strong>if you're not risking your own IP, then I can see why they have that perspective</strong>. So I think that's a general thing that's causing me some hesitation across the board right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You're exactly right. It has to be a creator. I mean, <strong>that's why I love what 3LAU's doing with Royal</strong> because he'd like programmed all this stuff for his own website around being able to mint directly from his website. And like, he's put in the years of doing this as a creator. And he knows like with this fractionalization for NAS, <strong>he knows what musicians want because he is one</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the discussion I've also had with people, it's look, this is me, <strong>you're essentially taking a piece of me and you're just gonna say, &#8216;Oh, yeah, we'll figure that out later.' It's like, &#8216;No, I value my IP way more.'</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So as of January, February '22, we don't feel like there's a site that's got everything we need yet. But equally, don't sign a contract that essentially gives a publisher &#8220;all formats existing now, or to be created for the life of copyright.&#8221;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, I would not agree to any of those clauses!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: No, because basically, what we're talking about it is <strong>essentially a new format, it is a digital limited edition or a special edition</strong>. I reckon publishers will fight over the definition of ebooks as well. But definitely <strong>don't sign a clause that means you can't do this because it's really not clear how it's going to shake out</strong>. So what else do we want when it comes to an NFT platform for books?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I think there's another angle to this that I think is being overlooked right now, and that is the <strong>reader experience or the collector experience</strong>. Rightfully so, most of these marketplaces, even the ones we're talking about, they're focusing on people who are into crypto and people who are NFT collectors. But that's not how you're going to get the mainstream over there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <strong>the fact that the default community tool is Discord is problematic, in my opinion</strong>. And I told that to the Book Coin guys, I said, &#8216;Hey, you know, Discord is great if you want to gather NFT collectors, but your average author and reader have no idea what Discord is.' And so that's a barrier right there. So <strong>I think there's a lack of focus on what the experience is for a reader as opposed to an NFT collector because I think those are two different archetypes</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I totally agree. And in fact, you and I have even talked about, do we need an NFT for books-specific marketplace? As in, could we just use a marketplace that's designed for something else? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But equally, like I went on OpenSea, and they don't allow an EPUB. So that kind of meant that you couldn't do it with just directly like on OpenSea which is a marketplace. But although what will happen is there will <strong>inevitably be multiple companies</strong>, we're not saying that one of these will turn out to be the Amazon of Web 3, I mean, I'm sure they hope they will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I actually think <strong>they'll be multiple marketplaces like there are for art and music, and all of this type of thing</strong>. But because of the way blockchain is structured, and they give us sort of cross-chain development that's going on, you should be able to resell on other marketplaces anyway, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Absolutely. And I think too like this also gets to the core of what we're talking about here. Like OpenSea won't allow an EPUB, I'm guessing they allow a PDF. Well, what hardcore reader wants to read a PDF? Nobody, right? They want the physical copy. They want the book in their hand, or they want a file that they can sideload or put onto a device and read. Reading on a PDF is one of the worst experiences of anything. And if you don't know that, and you're thinking, &#8216;Well, we're going to make an NFTs and we're going to deliver PDFs,' well, who wants those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah. I totally agree. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We want a marketplace that's easy to navigate, easy to use. I also want flexibility on terms of my smart contract. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What I've seen when I've dived into some of the terms and conditions on multiple of these sites, I've had a look, is that they're going with a standard smart contract that we've set up already. So if you click mint, then it just executes a standard contract with one wallet. So you can only have one wallet for your whole kind of user. And think about that as like a equivalent of a PayPal account, for example, so you can only use one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas, I want <strong>flexibility on the terms of the NFT, the duration of the NFT smart contract, and I want to be able to split between different wallets so that we can do collaboration</strong>. People are saying, &#8216;Oh, well, we can add that in later.' But the fact is if I create something with a smart contract, that's it. It's set on the blockchain and maybe that's 20 years or something, or life of copyright, like, that sets it in stone. And therefore, like any other contract, it means I can't use that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Exactly. And that's why we're saying like, we need some of this figured out now. It's not a wait, we'll figure it out later. I agree, though. And I think too, it's important to recognize that the whole thing with Web 3 is it's decentralized. I don't think there's going to be a single website like an Amazon for book NFTS. I think there are going to be dozens and they might splinter according to genre, they could splinter according to style. I don't know, I'm totally guessing. But I don't think there will be just one, which makes it all the more important to have some of that cross-chain operability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because otherwise, what you don't want to get into is a situation where if I use a real-world example like, I'm only selling this NFT in France and you can only pay it with a euro. And that's it. Like if you want to buy this product in England, you can't because it's only available in France. And that's the analogy I think of with these different blockchains if there's not some sort of omnichain, or way to transact across them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I guess we should say is that we're really moving into a point where <strong>the smart people who are into this stuff are building the architecture of what this will turn into</strong>. So I almost feel like we're seeing what we want and I absolutely expect it will come. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember, years ago, the Kindle first came out in America, and I was like, &#8216;Hey, I want that. Excuse me, I'm in Australia. Can I have that, please?' And they're like, &#8216;No, we're not doing that.' And then they opened up the KDP to Americans. And again, I'm like, &#8216;Hey, can I have that?' And then for years, we didn't have pre-orders, do you remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: We didn't have pre-orders for maybe six years of my indie career, and I was like, &#8216;I just want pre-orders, please, let us have pre-orders. What is the big deal with this?' And then eventually, we got pre-orders and. Like, <strong>all these things do happen. It's just a matter of when they happen</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we're saying, we're not going to wait forever until everything is sorted out, but I'm not doing a drop until at least the financial like, is it a product or is it an asset? This is kind of a basic question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Right. Like, I need to be able to answer to my accountant come tax time. So those are some core questions that need to be answered. And <strong>I'm a bit baffled because I'm like, doesn't somebody know?</strong> Like, there are literally trillions of dollars being exchanged in crypto, like, doesn't somebody know? Like what about, you know, these whales that are buying millions of dollars worth of NFTs? Like, are they paying sales tax, or who is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, it is very complicated. I was actually reading an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b827f5c4-1278-4e36-8c5e-e450a325c16f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article in the &#8216;Financial Times' today about Switzerland</a> because people are like, &#8216;Oh, it'll never go mainstream.' And I'm like, &#8216;It's Switzerland, it's the banking capital of the world.' And Switzerland's a real crypto hub. And they're looking at all these questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that <strong>this is either going to be regulated or banned per market</strong>, right? So I think we're gonna see this by jurisdiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, the amusing thing about it is, how do you even know what jurisdiction you have to pay tax and what some jurisdiction? But you don't know where the wallet holder is, and your wallet could be&#8230;you know, who knows where it is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand the problems with this. But equally, I think we're seeing this in a long-term perspective, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I'm seeing it really, as the next 30 plus years of my career. The fundamentals of what will underpin my business model.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. There might be some people who are plugging their ears right now and don't want to hear this, but this is going to be our business for the coming decades. It's going to operate on this basic technological infrastructure, whether you like it or not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think we're all going to be in a better situation if we're thinking about and learning about this stuff now, as opposed to putting our heads in the sand and pretending like it's not coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. So a couple of things you've mentioned, Discord Server. Now, I just hate that phrase even. It's just terrible. I mean, the word server is just incredibly technical, whereas actually, it's not like a server, it's like a chat room, isn't it really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It's like a Slack group in that there are different channels. I hate Discord. I hate it. I'm only in them because <strong>that's where these communities are existing for the people in this space right now</strong>. And again, like I don't want to belabor the point, but like, your typical average author or reader doesn't even know what Discord is. And it's a terrible place to build a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And not even that, it's like I didn't join the Discord thing until really only the last six weeks, even though I'd already bought some tokens because I was like, &#8216;I do not need another thing in my life.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna:<strong> I don't want to have another thing to check, like, I really don't</strong>. And I think this is what people feel even if they don't mind the technical side, they're like, &#8216;I don't want something else.' And so, I think that's interesting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will give a shout-out to <a href=\"https://cryptoversalbooks.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cryptoversal Books</a> and I'll link in the show notes, they have a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/cryptoversal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook group for Cryptoversal</a>. Now, they're a new platform. They're looking at what they want to do, but kudos to them for starting a Facebook group and inviting discussion, and sharing things, and answering questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I'm going to link to that in the notes because I'm in that group. And I'm actually enjoying it more than the Discord because I feel like, I know how to use a Facebook group. Whereas the Discord, I go in and it's like, &#8216;Oh,' I just don't like it. So I think you're right. I think that's going to be difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If this is all so exciting, why are people still so overwhelmingly negative about NFTs and blockchain? What resistance are you seeing in your community, and anything we can do about it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: From my perspective, I think it's just <strong>good old-fashioned fear</strong>. I don't think it's more complicated than that, you know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>People don't understand the terminology.</strong> They don't necessarily understand the technology, I still don't understand how cryptocurrency works, and like writing to the block, and proof of stake like, I don't get all that either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there's a legitimate and valid concern that like, I don't understand this and that in two clicks of a button, <strong>I could end up losing all this money</strong>. The media plays stories about people who lost their seed phrase for their wallet, or such and such got hacked and stole X number of Bitcoin. It's no different than what happens in fiat, in the regular banking world and online, but like, it's scary stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think until there are some places where this Web 3 infrastructure is invisible, and people are just on it, sort of like PayPal. I don't know <strong>if you remember when online banking was first becoming a thing. Again, this would have been early to mid-2000s. All the same arguments were there.</strong> &#8216;Someone's going to break into my account, they're going to take all my money, I'm not ever buying anything online, someone will steal my credit card number.' And <strong>now we all transact online without giving it a second thought</strong>. So I think we're eventually going to get there, but it's those same basic fears that I'm hearing now that I heard 20 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I totally agree. And I also think <strong>the gatekeepers, the controllers, are invested in the old ways</strong>. Going back to Royal again, I imagine some people are not that happy that Royal's happening because if musicians just go straight to Royal, essentially you're crowdfunding and sharing in your royalties, I mean, that cuts out a heck of a lot of people in the supply chain of music to fans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <strong>the same will happen with books. And obviously, we've seen one stage of that with independent publishing.</strong> But the misinformation that we see about indie, and you know, listeners, I'm sure you've seen the misinformation, I still get it all the time. Like, &#8216;Oh, all self-published books are just crap. They're all really terrible and low quality.' I mean, we still get this stuff after, what, 15 years!?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And it's like, yeah, but you know what, <strong>if that's the story you want to believe, then that's fine. You don't have to do anything about it.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel like this area, if you spend a bit of time delving a bit deeper into it, and as we talked about, hopefully we'll have another conversation in a couple of months or something, and we'll just keep talking about this, and hopefully be able to shed some light on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We have to come back to the environmental concerns because I promised that before. So people always say, &#8216;Oh, but NFTs and blockchain are destroying the planet.' So what's your answer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Then stop using email. Because email uses way more resources than crypto does. That's a bit of a flippant answer and I don't mean to be facetious with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in all honesty, yes, there are concerns about environmental impacts. They are real. That is mostly on Ethereum. There are many, many smart people working hard to fix that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ethereum's energy usage will go down 99.95%</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have some blockchains like Solana and Tezos and Avalanche that will have very low gas fees, if any. So I think <strong>that is a problem that will go away, and it shouldn't be something that keeps you from learning about it now</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, you could take any slice of modern living, and you could find an egregious environmental impact from anything, whether from online streaming to email to social media, if you tally it up, the environmental impact from all those, I think they would be far greater than crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And as you said, <strong>there are new blockchains that have a different structure that takes less energy, but also Ethereum is looking to redesign itself to have less of a carbon footprint</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think people are definitely trying to solve all of the problems of environmental impact, not just with blockchain, but with everything else that we do. If you just do some googling around environmental concerns and blockchain, you're going to find lots of detailed information about how that's going to change. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If listeners want to take any action from this, what do you advise?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: The minimal action I would advise would be to click on some of the links in your show notes, and <strong>just start taking a look at some of these websites and marketplaces</strong>. And just reading them over, looking at what's on there, and getting familiar with what they are and what they're offering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you want to go one baby step further, <strong>maybe it's not a baby step, but purchase an NFT.</strong> I think that you will learn so much about what they are, and the perceived value, and communities that can go along with them if you buy one. So if you have any intention of creating your own NFT, then buying one would definitely be a smart thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You could just, on social media, have a look at some hashtags. Like on Instagram, I follow #darkNFT. Obviously, I would be doing that! And just some amazing art being created. And I mean, yes, that's visual art. But Instagram is a visual kind of platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what you can do is click through to create websites and see what people are doing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We're creators, we create intellectual property, and we license it, and we please readers with it. But we also make a living and we have a business. So both of us see this as the next phase really, the next phase in what is a very, very exciting time. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess circling right back to when we talked about, is this like 1997 all over again? Well, the internet didn't become the e-commerce and everything we do in 1997. It wasn't even in 2007. I think 2007 when the iPhone launched and when the Kindle launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it took at least another five years. So 2012, definitely things were starting to kick off. That's really when the early ebooks stuff was happening. 2014 podcasting started to make a ton of money. And I obviously started in 2009. <strong>I feel like these things sometimes take a decade. But remember, this isn't year one of blockchain</strong>. J and I surprisingly, are not on the forefront of blockchain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No. I listened to the Kevin Rose podcast today, and his guest was talking about the &#8220;good old days&#8221; of blockchain in 2018. And I was like, &#8216;Wow, this is moving fast.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, yes. So in fact, Simon-Pierre from Bookchain talked about this, is that his business plan was always a decade. And I think he started in 2015. So he's really seeing it to sort of 2025 as when that becomes like, totally mainstream. A bit like&#8230;you mentioned PayPal. Like PayPal, we didn't have PayPal in 2007, right? But we&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, I don't think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, I don't think I did. But then by 2017, we all did stuff with PayPal. And you and I pay each other with PayPal. So I mean, this is the thing, I mean, in terms of what I think the action, same as you, is listen to things, listen to podcasts. I've had a look at some of the books, and they are out of date within five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. There's maybe one I would recommend. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IPN2ih\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The NFT Handbook: How to Create, Sell and Buy Non-Fungible Tokens</a> by Matt Fortnow and Terry QuHarrison. There was a lot of useful stuff in there because it was more about the behavioral aspects of the NFT role as opposed to the technical ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Okay. That's great. Thank you. Right, so where can people find you, and your books, and everything you do online?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. Easiest thing to do is to go to <a href=\"https://www.theauthorlife.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">theauthorlife.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant.

So welcome back to the show, J.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Thanks, Joanna. I'm excited to be back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm excited to talk to you. So you and I talk about this topic offline away from the mic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes, quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I mean, amazingly, we actually have conversations away from a microphone. People might not believe it but we do. So let's start with the basics. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you explain NFTs to a non-technical audience?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Not well! But I just read something today that I think really crystallized it for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An NFT is proof of ownership.</strong> That's all it is. It's a receipt. And I think when you frame it that way, things start to make a lot more sense. So it's not necessarily a physical object. It's not necessarily even a digital object. It's proof of ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that's one good way of explaining it. <strong>I talk about it as like a box. A box that you can put stuff in</strong>, and we'll be talking about some of the examples of the stuff you can put in the box. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the NFT is essentially like the receipt showing you have access to the box, and then there are <strong>all the different kinds of things we can put in a box</strong>. I guess we should also say it is programmable in some way. So when you say a receipt, I might think in my mind, just a one-liner, which says, &#8216;I paid J some money and he edited my book,' or whatever. And that's like a one-liner. Whereas NFTs can contain, let's just use the word, smart contract which makes it more programmable, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. It's <strong>an immutable digital ledger that is spread across many different computers.</strong> We'll leave out the highly technical stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea is with an NFT, from the time it's created or minted for its entire lifespan, you can track who's owned it and when by the address of the wallet of the owner. So yes, it's much more detailed than a single-line receipt, and it does contain the history of that particular NFT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And then I guess we have to use the term blockchain. But, again, as we always say, <strong>you don't need to know how the internet works to use the internet.</strong> So you don't need to know all this technical stuff. It's the same with blockchain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what's most interesting at this point is <strong>NFTs can be on different blockchains. And the different blockchains have different properties associated with them</strong>. And I feel like some objections to blockchain technologies are because people have only heard of certain blockchains like Bitcoin. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what are some of the other blockchains that you've seen that you think are more interesting?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Well, I think from an author's perspective, I'm not entirely interested in Bitcoin simply because Bitcoin is more like stored value. It's the digital equivalent to gold. So you can hold gold and it has value, and you can sell it. But people don't really use gold to pay for things. And in much the same way, they don't really use Bitcoin transactionally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think for me, the next big one is <strong>Ethereum or Eth. And that one is the biggest blockchain right now as far as transactions go, especially with NFTs.</strong> But there are certain other side chains and level twos. And again, don't worry about the terminology. But there are blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Tezos. These are all <strong>different blockchains with different currencies that are popping up and filling different niches in the blockchain world</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And that's where some of them are dealing with the carbon thing, and we'll come back on the environmental topic which I know some people just have it in their heads. So we'll come back on that one. And they also have <strong>different fees for different transactions</strong>. So all of this stuff is just evidence of growth in a new industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But let's also be clear on what NFTs are NOT as it relates to intellectual property.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. I don't know if people are familiar with what happened with the &#8216;Dune' book, but it was auctioned, I believe, at Christie's. And the intention was SpiceDAO was going to turn it into an NFT project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their assumption, incorrectly, was that they owned copyright, or that they owned the IP to create derivatives or to change it. And there was a <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/cryptobros-spend-millions-rare-jodorowsky-dune-book-copyright-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">great article on The Next Web </a>that said that would be the equivalent of saying you bought a Jar Jar Binks toy and now you have the right to make a new &#8216;Star Wars' movie starring Jar Jar Binks. It doesn't work that way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so really, you do not own the intellectual property, you cannot create in it or on it. Think of it more as a work of art. So if you go to a gallery and you purchase a painting, you own that painting but you don't own the intellectual property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Just to put it on the book perspective, just on a really basic level, <strong>someone goes into a secondhand bookstore and they buy a secondhand copy of your book. So they own that book and they can resell that book, but they don't own the intellectual property of that book</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can't scan it, turn it into a Kindle book, and upload it onto Amazon and make money from it, or make a movie of it. So it's essentially exactly the same as the physical world as such, if they had bought a physical book, and then they just assumed they had this right to do stuff with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you also mentioned the DAO which we should just explain briefly. <strong>DAO stands for a decentralized autonomous organization.</strong> And I'm thinking about it as a collective of people who come together and you can, again, programmable ways of running an organization. Let's not go into that because I'm going to have a separate episode on DAOs. I think they're incredibly interesting from a legal and business perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for now, we're gonna stick with NFTs. So just to be very clear,<strong> copyright is not assumed in an NFT unless that is specified. </strong>And of course, I had someone on the show last year who talked about the communities of authors who are trying to grant copyright within a community, a bit like the Kindle world, where the author who wrote in that got the copyright over their book within the world, but not over the whole world. [<a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/10/29/the-ownership-economy-business-models-around-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Ownership Model with Jessica Artemisia in episode 561</a>.] Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It certainly does. That's a good way of explaining it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: So hopefully, that's given a bit of an overview and people who are new to this topic. Let's get into some more details. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why are you so excited about NFTs and blockchain for authors? And what are some of the benefits you can see in the years ahead?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. This is crazy stuff. I want to say, first of all, we are not tax professionals. We are not financial advisors. I'm barely scratching the surface of what Web 3 is. I'm an author who's really interested in this. So everything I'm going to say is not necessarily grounded in a ton of experience or research. It's my experience so far. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I'm really excited about at the highest level, <strong>because of where I was in my life stage in the early to mid-'90s, I feel like I missed out on the internet. Like the internet boom, right?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, if you think about what happened between, say, 1994 to 1999, there was an explosion of Web 1, starting to go into Web 2 with blogging and eventually, podcasting. And I was completely tied up in my day job and my family. And I knew what was happening but I wasn't really paying close attention to it. I wasn't participating in it. And this feels like that, and now I feel like I have the opportunity to participate. So I think on a very grand scale, I'm excited about a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have strong suspicions and feelings that <strong>Web 3, crypto, blockchain, all the stuff we're talking about is going to radically transform our lives</strong>, <strong>whether or not we understand the technology, in much the same way the internet has</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Those of us in our mid-40s, 50s, started to hear really about the internet in the late 90s. I mean, I didn't get an email until I think '95, you know, an email address. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we're talking about <strong>Web 1, we're really talking about static websites</strong> where it's like, you can't do anything. It was just like the Yellow Pages online (if you remember the Yellow Pages!). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Web 2 is the more interactive internet, blogging, podcasting, social media</strong>. I mean, what we're in now is still kind of the end-stage of Web 2, e-commerce, that type of thing on more interactive websites, creator, content, posted social media, that kind of thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Web 3 is what we're seeing with the metaverse, blockchain, converging technologies with AI,</strong> different ways of doing things that will empower the creative economy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what specifically for authors are you excited about in terms of, I guess, the creative or business potential of NFTs?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I think you're correct in saying potential, that is the right word. So what I'm going to discuss is not necessarily something that we can start right now, although the technology's there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what really has me excited about, specifically, <strong>NFTs for authors, is it's a paradigm shift</strong>. We are going to have the ability to sell directly to fans and readers to create communities directly without any sort of middle entity, without a marketplace. And I know we can do this now in selling direct, but I think here's the takeaway like, if this is all Greek to you or you don't understand what we're talking about, this is at its core where I think it's going to<strong> fundamentally change the way authors sell and do business is the digital resale</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So with NFTs and with the way you can structure a smart contract, an author can get paid on the resale of anything, whether that's a physical book or a digital book. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think about that, you think about like, if you sell a paperback and someone who bought your paperback goes and sells it to a used bookstore, and someone else comes in and buys that book from the used bookstore, you as the author receive zero from that. But <strong>imagine, in perpetuity, you as the author receive 10% of that resell forever</strong>. I think that's just a radical idea that's going to completely change the way we do business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And that's why I think so many people haven't got this yet because it hasn't happened before. The penny hasn't dropped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the publishing industry and some of the things I've seen online from agents and publishers who&#8230; Well, I guess, this is another difference, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You and I (and the listeners) are creators. We create Intellectual Property. We are the Creator Economy. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And so everything we put out into the world with our name on it that we own the IP for, we get money for some kind of licensing on that. And <strong>it's all funded by what we actually make</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas people who work in the publishing industry, generally get a salary that is not related to the licensing of their own IP. So I feel like sometimes people aren't understanding this because they aren't actually creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I'm very excited about the same reason as you because resale opens up for the life of copyright. Okay, this is what's so exciting with a programmable smart contract. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I create an NFT now and someone buys it for, let's say, $250. And, you know, that's nice. But what then happens is <strong>they can resell that over time and I get a percentage of that resale</strong>. So they could sell it next year, and maybe because I'm such a prolific creator, the value has gone up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe it's now worth $400 and I get 10% of that. So I get like 40 bucks, just turns up in my wallet. And then I do something and I manage to hit some list or I win an award, and <strong>suddenly the value of my IP is worth more</strong>. So my trading value on of my NFTs goes up too. And maybe I've created more limited editions of things. And so the value of my intellectual property suddenly just expands into this incredible realm. That's why I'm excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. It's funny you used that example of winning awards or having a breakout hit, where I was thinking like, I'll probably say something stupid or get arrested, and that'll make the value of mine go up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah, but there is that, you just don't know. I mean, the funny thing is I really feel like right now, this is fiction particularly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fiction business model right now, I feel, is almost broken because the rise of subscription models for ebooks and digital audio are tending the income for fiction digital products down. It's sloping down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yes, sure there's print on demand. But many indies make far more with digital products for fiction, in particular. This doesn't count with nonfiction because nonfiction is, I think, far more resilient. And then you've got ads, the fact that we have to pay for ads. So I've been feeling for a while, like, frustrated that our business model just can't last another decade. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But this to me feels like the pivot, it feels like with special editions — let's call them special digital editions NFTs — we are suddenly going to explode and expand the fiction possibilities and the fiction business model. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with collaboration. Like you and I, right, we still have to fanny around with paying each other for various projects. You know, whereas if we had smart contracts, the money just arrives in your account, in your wallet automatically. So it <strong>opens up the potential for collaboration</strong> and so much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Totally agree. And I think this is probably going to bridge into the conversation around NFTs in the nonfiction space. But I think there are some <strong>opportunities in fiction that can build upon habits and behaviors we already have, and leverage the power of the technology</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here's a very rudimentary example. Let's say that you as a fiction author offer a book club to your core readers. And let's say, you and 20 readers are going to get together and you're going to hold a book club meeting. And those people are coming to that because they're drawn to you, they want to support you. So imagine now that you sell an NFT that is your seat in this book club. And now you own that seat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as time goes on, if you want to sell it to someone else, you can. And as you mentioned, if your stock as an author goes up, or if you become more in demand, or your time was more limited, the perceived value on that book club seat grows as well. So it's just one small example of the way I think NFTs have the potential to really change the way fiction authors sell and market too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, let's get into that question then. So if the NFT unlocks a digital box of things, let's talk about those different things. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So you just mentioned access to a book club through an NFT. Talk about that in your idea for nonfiction-based community and masterminds?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. So I'm currently in what I'm calling an NFT beta phase where I have a small subset of people within my author community who&#8230;they raised their hand and said they want to be part of this. And we don't have it all figured out yet, but we are in the middle of figuring out, okay, how can we create this subgroup, this smaller group that has access? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the problems with NFTs right now is that the lingo and the tech bros who are talking about this stuff are using <strong>language that excludes the average person because they feel stupid, like, they don't know what they're talking about</strong>. That's always bothered me with technology and it's still here, but, you know, it's not that complicated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <strong>having the ability to create access is different than buying a JPEG</strong>. So if you look at the news stories, all the news stories around, you know, &#8216;Someone paid $69 million for this JPEG, why would they do that?' And a JPEG is one type of NFT. It's probably the most popular one. But as you mentioned, if you think about it more as a digital box, you can put anything in there. Like Gary Vaynerchuk is doing really innovative stuff with his NFTs [<a href=\"https://veefriends.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Veefriends</a>] that includes access to him, attendance at physical live events, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So the sky's the limit here as far as what you can put into that digital box.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. So I guess what you're talking about there is the idea of a community coin which you and I are in some other kind of futurist communities around this, and if you buy one of these tokens or an NFT that can represent a ticket to something, then it gives you access. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was talking to a friend of mine who is a coach. And he was kind of struggling to understand this potential for his business model. And I was telling him about <strong>the NFT smart contract doesn't have to be for the life of copyright. It doesn't have to be a product.</strong> We'll circle back to products in a minute. It can be a service, like you're saying, it could be access to a community. And I said to him, &#8216;Well, it could be access to six months coaching.' So someone buys the token upfront.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I said, &#8216;What is awesome is this functionality called airdropping,' right? So <strong>you airdrop extra special things to anyone holding a token of yours</strong>. So maybe you've done a special audio that goes out to everyone holding your token, or maybe you've commissioned some art to go with your project, or maybe you just do something special which you can then airdrop to anyone holding one of your tokens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were talking about the <strong>benefits for your long-term kind of client maintenance</strong> <strong>and brand-building</strong> of being able to send something, it's like, &#8216;Surprise, here's an awesome extra for you,' or you know, a lesson on something if it's nonfiction, or if it's fiction, a bonus chapter or something. And then it arrives in people's wallet. And it almost, I don't want to say it replaces email, but <strong>it becomes this way to deliver surprising delightful things to an audience who have already invested in you</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Absolutely. And as you mentioned, <strong>it doesn't have to be something that lasts forever. You can almost think of an NFT as an enhanced concert ticket</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let's say a musician wants to put on a show and much like on a Patreon or Kickstarter, they create several tiers of access, and you purchase the NFT for whatever level of access you want. And once you've purchased that NFT, everything else is controlled by the program. So you could scan the NFT, you could sell it to someone else, you could trade it, the NFT knows where you're supposed to be, and where you're not. And especially in a digital world, <strong>I can fully imagine NFTs or tokens of some kind replacing membership software.</strong> If your membership site can read the address in your wallet, knows you belong there, you're just in. You don't need a password. You don't need to register. It's all automated, and I think there's a lot of potential there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah, absolutely. Well, let's talk about some of the other things you might do. So you're, obviously, incredibly great at communities. That's one of your superpowers, and it's not one of mine. And so I am far more interested in&#8230; I think even my dad's a visual artist. He was a sculptor and now he's a printmaker, and my brother's a photographer, and <strong>we come from a more of a visual arts family</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I am also starting to create art around my worlds with AI generation tools, which is a whole &#8216;nother podcast! But I feel like for me, the business model I'm interested in is what I mentioned before, which is <strong>creating NFTs of limited digital editions</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, with the short story, I just put out, <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/blood-sweat-and-flame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blood, Sweat, and Flame</a>, which is set in the glassblowing world. That's just a short story, right? But the ideas I have for the NFTs I could do around that short story just opened the world up to other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/blood-sweat-and-flame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-1024x536.png\" alt=\"Blood Sweat Flame\" class=\"wp-image-33943\" width=\"544\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-1024x536.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-300x157.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner-768x402.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blood-Sweat-Flame-Banner.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So a collaboration with an artist, or making my own art, for example, or creating a postscript on the story of what happened next, or collaborating with a glass artist to do a video. There's lots of things I can do to make a limited edition version of these books. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Now, in my mind, these are all individually different. So I only see myself doing like three or five, or maybe even 10 individual NFTs for each book. And that would be like a collection. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the collection would be per book, and each one would be different. So even like, superfans might buy more than one because they love whatever it is that I've included. And then over time, <strong>my collections will grow and grow around the IP that I have in my universes</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to me, <strong>this is making me feel so much more creative because I've got so many ideas that suddenly become viable within this space</strong>. And I know lots of fiction authors who've already commissioned art and things like this that they could include in NFT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I wish I had more hours in the day, Joanna, because I'm like you. I can honestly say that the whole <strong>NFT craze of 2021 was the sole reason I started picking up my guitar again</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hadn't taken my guitar out of its case for years, and I started to see what was happening and I thought, &#8216;Wow, music is another great place.' So you mentioned the graphic arts, which is clearly a wonderful opportunity. And the same with the visual and the auditory arts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if you're a musician and <strong>you have the ability to create original music, you could tie that to your fiction to different stories</strong>. And I'm actively working on writing some music now that I think will tie into several things that I'm working on. And I don't need a major record label, I don't need to go through Spotify. These are things that my audience might be interested in, and I can sell directly to them. So I agree with you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I'm so excited. It's really restoked a lot of my creative fire outside of just the writing and publishing.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Awesome. I'm so happy to hear that. I hope people listening can hear our excitement. And I do feel like we're pretty, let's say, &#8216;mature' in the indie space. We've been around the block a few times in the indie world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it can become a little bit sort of, &#8216;Yes, I know how to write a book now, I know how to sell a book, I know how to market a book, and I'll just do it again.' And yes, every book is interesting in its way. But <strong>there's so much more that we want to do with the ideas. And this finally gives us a chance to do it.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do want to ask about another example, which you forwarded to me earlier, about royalty rights to songs. Now, this could also apply to books. So talk about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: This is fascinating. And I'm not surprised it's happening in the music industry because artists in that industry have been exploited for a long time. And I think they see Web 3.0 as an opportunity to gain back some of their rights and their IP and their revenue, quite frankly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>NAS, big-time rapper, is selling royalty rights to two of his songs through NFTs. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is on a platform called <a href=\"https://royal.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">royal.io</a> and it's brand new. So there's not much there yet. But just to give you a sense of what's possible. [<a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/nas-to-sell-royalty-rights-to-two-of-his-songs-as-nfts-3133351\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Full article on NME here</a>.]He's creating tokens around one song. He created three levels, the gold, the platinum, and the diamond. At the gold level, which is $50, so you pay $50 And you get access to his Discord and you get some sort of&#8230;he calls it a sweet chick secret menu. I don't know what that is but it must be valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Sounds cool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. And you also get <strong>0.143% ownership of his streaming royalties on that song. So when that song is played, you're going to share in that revenue.</strong> On the platinum level, it's $250 to buy in. You get everything with gold, plus you get exclusive merch, and in that you get the 0.857% of streaming royalties. And then the top tier of the diamond, you get everything for gold and platinum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also get two VIP concert tickets, exclusive signed vinyl, a video conversation with him, and 2.14% of streaming royalties, and that package costs $5,000. So you can already see how artists are empowering&#8230;not only empowering their audience, they're bringing them along. And I think this is again, one of those fundamental differences. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You're not only supporting the artists but you are benefiting from their success. Everybody wins in this situation.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: There's a few things out of this. First of all, <strong>you've got baked in marketing for everyone who buys a token because everyone is incentivized to go stream NAS on whatever platform</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, as we know, if you send traffic and get more people streaming, the algorithms like it, and they bump you up. So if you get all those token holders streaming and telling their friends, &#8216;Hey, stream NAS this weekend at your party or whatever,' you get baked in marketing which is brilliant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, this is, I believe, is called <strong>fractionalization where you're essentially splitting this into micropayments</strong>, and <strong>this is exactly what we need in the publishing space</strong>. And just for something that people ask me all the time, I get so many emails, and I wanted to do this too with my first book, which is I want to give 10% of my profits to charity. How do I do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those ways. <strong>You could put in your smart contract a 10% fraction that goes directly to a charity's digital wallet</strong> if they set one up, that's another way of looking at it. But I think that's amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love Royal, the CEO is <a href=\"https://3lau.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3LAU</a>; I think you pronounce his name, Blau, 3-L-A-U. He is the one who got me into this. About a year ago, I heard him speak at a conference, online, obviously, because of the pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>And when he spoke about blockchain and music, I saw our future because he's a creator, he is an artist. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And he's not well known as far as I know in the normal world. But he just ran with blockchain early, and the guy is just doing so well. And obviously now what he started, Royal, and this is probably going to be billions of dollars for him now because <strong>he's done the architecture for other musicians</strong>. So yeah, that's amazing, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It is. And it's very easy to just say, &#8216;Okay, substitute a novel for song,' right? Like, we can take the same structure and this is <strong>what I'm working on right now, is I want to be able to fractionalize the royalties from my books</strong>, and I want to be able to give 0.5% or 1% to hundreds, you know&#8230;well, not hundreds, I can't do the math there. But <strong>I want to be able to fractionalize and give percentages or parts of percentages of royalties to readers because now they're incentivized to, as you said, market the book, and everybody wins</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the book sells, I make money and they make money. And it works all the way around. So the fact that this structure is already in place, that <strong>there are artists, creatives who are doing this, it's just a matter of time before it comes to us</strong>. And I can't wait for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I agree. And this is another kind of <strong>principle of Web 3, right? So you're rewarded for participation in a community.</strong> So whereas like at the moment, you're on Twitter, and I like, &#8216;Oh, you know, J's my friend, I really want to support him. I'll tweet here about his book or whatever.' And then that's helping in a way. In the future, we'll be able to help each other or support the creators we love by buying tokens, we support them, we also get a cut. So that's really amazing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now social networks on blockchain where you get rewarded for participation, and you get coins for what your participation is. There is obviously gaming, play to earn, I think it's called where you can play games on blockchain and earn coin, and there are people making full-time livings from this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Check out this <a href=\"https://yaro.blog/32703/web3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introductory article on Web 3 by Yaro Starak</a>. It has examples of all these different kinds of participatory platforms.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is not the future anymore, is it? It's kind of right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, it's not. And I'm not a gamer so I don't know the world. But I do know that NFTs and <strong>tokenization of gaming is probably what's gonna be the gasoline on the fire here</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the big companies get behind this, or once there are some indies who start understanding how blockchain works, because this is the kind of thing that's been happening with traditional currency for years. I mean, kids were, you know, in &#8216;Roblox' or &#8216;Minecraft,' or whatever you want to call it, they're going in there buying digital weapons and digital outfits, and this is already happening. So there's no stopping it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And we should say, you mentioned there, big companies. I mean, <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft just bought a massive gaming company</a> which you guys covered on the &#8216;Writers, Ink,' which was great. But also I've seen news articles that <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/youtube-cryptocurrency-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube's looking at NFTs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893502/nft-twitter-profile-picture-crypto-wallet-opensea-coinbase-right-click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter is looking at incorporating NFTs</a>. Facebook/Meta is looking at NFTs [<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Financial Times</a>]. And when these big companies are looking at it, that's when it will go more mainstream. I mean, let's just be clear, I have not bought an NFT. I am excited as a creator. There is a creator I really love but his work has already like blown up massively. But you have bought one. Tell us about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>J: I've purchased a few NFTs but the one I'm really excited about is called ZIGGURAT. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And the <a href=\"https://ziggurats.xyz/#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ZIGGURAT</a> was created by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park. And he calls it a generative mixtape. So what he did is he created, I think it was 8,000 or 9,000 NFTs. And what he did was, they're a <strong>combination of a profile picture style graphic and music</strong>. And he created different characteristics, different variables. So everything from hair color to eye color to facial expressions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the music track, there were 10 or 15 different drum beats, different melodies, different instrumentation. So he created all of these core building blocks, so to speak, of both the graphic image and the audio. And then he fed that into an AI. And the <strong>AI then kicked out 8,000 unique NFTs. So no two are the same</strong>. Now they might share certain attributes, but every single one of those is unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I heard about this, I just thought that sounds like the coolest thing ever. And I went, and <strong>on the day it dropped it sold out instantly.</strong> It's on the Tezos blockchain. So I ended up buying one of the secondary market. I think the original minting, it was the equivalent of about $75. And when I bought it, it was maybe $110, so it cost me a little bit more. But I have one now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>And it's so creative and it's so unique. And I thought if I'm going to get into the space, I need to know what it feels like to be a fan, to be a consumer. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kind of got that experience and it was really fun. And people are tired of hearing me talk about it because I share it everywhere, but it was a great example of being super creative and using the technology in a way that hadn't been done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And it's funny because you talked about it, I was like, &#8216;Oh yeah, I used to listen to Linkin Park back in the day, put them on the Spotify playlist, revisiting like, '90s when I used to listen to these things.' So I think it's really interesting. And what you've done there is <strong>you're a fan of the music, you know that creator</strong>. I mean, he has name recognition amongst certain people, obviously, but you're a fan. So that's a great example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That generative mixtape idea, I actually did a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaCgydeMu64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one-hour tutorial on how to do that at the weekend</a>. And it was for the visual ones. And I mean, I'm not a programmer, but this guy really kind of took it from even if you don't know programming you can do this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is kind of a sub-question though because I've been into AI generative work for a while now and words, as well as images, and you're talking about music there, but you were not that much of a fan of AI art generation a year ago. So has that changed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, it hasn't. I knew you were gonna put me on the spot on this, I was prepared. This might be semantics and maybe I just need to get over myself, but I think the difference here is that Mike didn't use AI to create the components, he used it to assemble them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: But that's what I do, I assemble. I put the input in and I assemble what comes out. So yes, I think it is semantics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, it's been going around in the art space, the <a href=\"https://app.wombo.art/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WOMBO Dream app</a>. Rachael Herron put some of her pictures. Get the app or get it on your desktop. And what I'm doing with that is I'm <strong>creating like word clouds separately from my novels. And then you create images with AI from a string of words.</strong> <strong>So you enter the words and then it outputs a unique image based on your words.</strong> So your words will always be different to my words. And, essentially they're going to have a minting button soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"450\" height=\"731\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Generative-art-created-by-words-from-J.F.-Penns-Stone-of-Fire-input-into-Wombo-Dream-app.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33944\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Generative-art-created-by-words-from-J.F.-Penns-Stone-of-Fire-input-into-Wombo-Dream-app.png 450w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Generative-art-created-by-words-from-J.F.-Penns-Stone-of-Fire-input-into-Wombo-Dream-app-185x300.png 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /><figcaption>AI Generative art created by words from J.F. Penn's Stone of Fire and Wombo Dream app, Jan 2022</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I love this idea that I can take my words and turn them into visual art. And in the same way, there's obviously now AI generative music which is another art form. So I mean, this is a sub-topic. We're going to come back on this sub-topic, I think. But that's just on a practical level. For someone to create 9,000, 10,000 individual NFTs, you have to have some help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Because I said before <strong>if I do 3 or 5 or 10 because I'm going to individually make them, which is different. I can assemble those separately. I don't need an AI to help me create them.</strong> So I think people have to consider what kind of collections they want to do, what kind of audience they're looking for. I mean, you wouldn't do 10,000 community tokens, would you, I guess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No. And I mean, even going back to Royal, like, there were only&#8230;I think there were only a total of 750 tokens, 760 tokens total. So yeah, it doesn't have to be a crypto punks or a massive collection, you can make one of ones. And I think that's more of what you're talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I think, again, that's because I guess what I've seen my dad do as a visual artist. And it's so funny. And <strong>one of my phrases for this year is &#8220;more digital, more physical.&#8221;</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as in, I want to get more into all this digital stuff but I also want to do more physical stuff. So I did a bookbinding course years ago, but I'm going on another one. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I want to make physical products too. I want to make limited edition physical products. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on my <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JFPenn.com</a> redesigned website, which I'm going to do later this year, it will have limited editions as a page. And on that page, it will have <strong>limited physical editions and limited NFT editions</strong>. That's how I want to educate people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I love that. And I'm thinking along the same lines with music and thinking of doing the digital files, obviously, but maybe a limited press vinyl, or a limited number of CDs. And so in the physical world, as well as in the digital world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: There you go. And I hope&#8230;that kind of crosses the gap, doesn't it? These are limited editions. But equally with those physical products, once they're sold, they're gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: They are gone. So you're never gonna get any more money for that. But I just like the idea. I think that's cool. Okay, anything else on any ideas? So look, and this is just off the top of our heads and we haven't even started yet. I mean, <strong>you can put video in, you can do audio, obviously, I'm going to do scans of my hand edits</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the partnership idea with other artists. In the past, we've obviously done written products together like <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/risengods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Risen Gods</a>, but you can do an NFT for an audio-only product, like a private conversation between Joanna Penn and J. Thorne. There are lots of things you can do that people will be interested in if they're in your community, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Absolutely. And as we said with the whole smart contract thing, it doesn't require us finagling around and doing all the accounting. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In the smart contract, we put ourselves as co-creators and our percentages, and then anytime that sells, it just ends up in our wallet.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah. So I guess both of us are&#8230;I mean, you're more heavily into the music space, I'm probably more heavily into the art space. But <strong>we're watching these communities who are ahead of us like, they're ahead of publishing. And music's always like two to five years ahead</strong>, would you say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It feels that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: So I would say we've probably got at least another year before we get a platform that works for authors. Well, let's talk about platforms. Okay. So everyone's now really excited now — if they haven't turned off already!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: The people who are here are loving it, though!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: They are like, &#8216;Yeah, tell us more. Tell us more. How can I do one?' Okay, so hold up, hold your horses. We're recording this on the 26th of January, 2022. We're going to probably do another one of these in a couple of months, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It will all change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: <strong>It'll all change. But the principles should remain.</strong> So there are <strong>different companies emerging with different business models for NFTs in publishing</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I do see some early adopters jumping in. I've had some people on my podcast like <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/11/05/creatokia-digital-originals-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Creatokia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/03/12/blockchain-for-publishing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookchain</a>. I've got some meetings with some other people. You've had some meetings with some other people. There's already like 10 on my list already. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are your thoughts on any companies you want to mention and anything that you've seen is particularly interesting?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Well, the one I want to mention, and I'll be fully transparent and say that I'm a moderator on their Discord server, so I'm not getting compensated monetarily, but I'm definitely interested in what they're doing, is <a href=\"https://www.bookcoin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bookcoin.com</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of all of the NFT book sites that are popping up, I'm most intrigued by Book Coin, and for a number of reasons. If you go to bookcoin.com, I think <strong>their messaging is crystal clear, and they're trying to carve out a market</strong>. And right now, what their value proposition is, &#8220;own a quote, a character, or a chapter from your favorite book.&#8221; And their first drop is going to be next month in February of 2022. And it's gonna be Mark Manson's book and a New York Times' bestseller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: We should say that is &#8216;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***,' which I'm sure everyone's heard of. It was one of the first to use that language in a book title, and then everyone did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes. And it was massive and is massively successful. Mark Manson just finished working with Will Smith on a memoir. But anyway, the Book Coin guys, they have Alan Watts and Alan Watts collection coming up after the Mark Manson drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I don't know who that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. He's a sort of 20th-century philosopher type, I guess would be the best way to describe him. But I think what Book Coin is doing is they're <strong>starting with name recognition. They're starting with authors that everyone knows as a way to bridge that gap</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that's an approach I really like because <strong>until they have a platform that's mature and developed, and that readers feel comfortable going to, indies or self-publishers have no hope of getting any discoverability</strong>. So I'm really interested in Book Coin. And as I said, I'm working for them as a moderator because I really believe in what they're doing. And that first drop comes next month. So I think things are gonna start rolling pretty fast there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Okay, that's interesting. Now, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/11/05/creatokia-digital-originals-nfts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Creatokia who I had on the podcast in episode 583</a>, I've been talking to them about things and they're working with a lot of the publishing industry. They're a German company and they're very well known for their work in digital audio and ebooks within Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what's interesting about Creatokia, I guess is because their company is <a href=\"https://www.bookwire.de/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookwire</a>, they have a reputation in the publishing industry. They're also German and the EU has rules around crypto, around finances, around tax, I mean, the EU has a lot more stringent stuff. So why I'm interested in them is because <strong>I feel like they're going to do it in the right way</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can't get into it because we don't know ourselves, like, we have lots of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the financial implications? What are these for tax? Are they a product? Are they a service? Are they an asset? How does the tax work on the first sale? How does it work on the resale? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are things we don't know yet which is why I'm kind of holding off. So Creatokia is definitely looking at all these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also had <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/03/12/blockchain-for-publishing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookchain on last year, Simon-Pierre Marion in episode 538</a>, they're out of Canada. They're on the Ethereum blockchain and they're looking more at the infrastructure side, as in not really a marketplace. And then there's some other ones that we're both looking at. I'll put a list in the show notes for this episode of the companies that I know about right now. And over time, there were going to be more of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bookchain</li><li>Publica</li><li>Creatokia</li><li>Soltype</li><li>Readl</li><li>Bookcoin</li><li>Bookvolts</li><li>CryptoversalBooks</li><li>PageDAO</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we're waiting for one because there's no specific company that's ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>When I upload an NFT, I'm essentially creating a smart contract, that could last for a very long time. So it has to be right. It has to be automated. I have to know what it means financially. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is like signing a contract for the life of copyright if that's your&#8230;you know, if you haven't term-limited your NFT. So that's why I have some hesitation. What about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Same. <strong>I had intended on minting an NFT by now, but the platforms just aren't ready yet</strong>. <strong>And like you said, there are just too many unanswered questions</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have one friend who has a marketplace on the Solana blockchain and I had a great conversation with him. But even he still isn't sure about a lot of this. I think this goes back to&#8230; I'm making a broad generalization here, but it'll make a point. You mentioned earlier that we are much more interested as creators because we're the ones creating the IP. I feel like <strong>some of the people who are building the marketplaces or building the infrastructure, they don't see that same risk because they're not putting their IP out there. They're getting paid to build it.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in some of these conversations I've had, there's this sort of, &#8216;Oh, yeah, we'll figure that out.' And I'm like, &#8216;No, we need to figure that out first.' Like, we can't just put stuff up there and figure it out later. But again, <strong>if you're not risking your own IP, then I can see why they have that perspective</strong>. So I think that's a general thing that's causing me some hesitation across the board right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You're exactly right. It has to be a creator. I mean, <strong>that's why I love what 3LAU's doing with Royal</strong> because he'd like programmed all this stuff for his own website around being able to mint directly from his website. And like, he's put in the years of doing this as a creator. And he knows like with this fractionalization for NAS, <strong>he knows what musicians want because he is one</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the discussion I've also had with people, it's look, this is me, <strong>you're essentially taking a piece of me and you're just gonna say, &#8216;Oh, yeah, we'll figure that out later.' It's like, &#8216;No, I value my IP way more.'</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So as of January, February '22, we don't feel like there's a site that's got everything we need yet. But equally, don't sign a contract that essentially gives a publisher &#8220;all formats existing now, or to be created for the life of copyright.&#8221;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, I would not agree to any of those clauses!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: No, because basically, what we're talking about it is <strong>essentially a new format, it is a digital limited edition or a special edition</strong>. I reckon publishers will fight over the definition of ebooks as well. But definitely <strong>don't sign a clause that means you can't do this because it's really not clear how it's going to shake out</strong>. So what else do we want when it comes to an NFT platform for books?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: I think there's another angle to this that I think is being overlooked right now, and that is the <strong>reader experience or the collector experience</strong>. Rightfully so, most of these marketplaces, even the ones we're talking about, they're focusing on people who are into crypto and people who are NFT collectors. But that's not how you're going to get the mainstream over there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <strong>the fact that the default community tool is Discord is problematic, in my opinion</strong>. And I told that to the Book Coin guys, I said, &#8216;Hey, you know, Discord is great if you want to gather NFT collectors, but your average author and reader have no idea what Discord is.' And so that's a barrier right there. So <strong>I think there's a lack of focus on what the experience is for a reader as opposed to an NFT collector because I think those are two different archetypes</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I totally agree. And in fact, you and I have even talked about, do we need an NFT for books-specific marketplace? As in, could we just use a marketplace that's designed for something else? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But equally, like I went on OpenSea, and they don't allow an EPUB. So that kind of meant that you couldn't do it with just directly like on OpenSea which is a marketplace. But although what will happen is there will <strong>inevitably be multiple companies</strong>, we're not saying that one of these will turn out to be the Amazon of Web 3, I mean, I'm sure they hope they will be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I actually think <strong>they'll be multiple marketplaces like there are for art and music, and all of this type of thing</strong>. But because of the way blockchain is structured, and they give us sort of cross-chain development that's going on, you should be able to resell on other marketplaces anyway, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Absolutely. And I think too like this also gets to the core of what we're talking about here. Like OpenSea won't allow an EPUB, I'm guessing they allow a PDF. Well, what hardcore reader wants to read a PDF? Nobody, right? They want the physical copy. They want the book in their hand, or they want a file that they can sideload or put onto a device and read. Reading on a PDF is one of the worst experiences of anything. And if you don't know that, and you're thinking, &#8216;Well, we're going to make an NFTs and we're going to deliver PDFs,' well, who wants those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yeah. I totally agree. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We want a marketplace that's easy to navigate, easy to use. I also want flexibility on terms of my smart contract. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What I've seen when I've dived into some of the terms and conditions on multiple of these sites, I've had a look, is that they're going with a standard smart contract that we've set up already. So if you click mint, then it just executes a standard contract with one wallet. So you can only have one wallet for your whole kind of user. And think about that as like a equivalent of a PayPal account, for example, so you can only use one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas, I want <strong>flexibility on the terms of the NFT, the duration of the NFT smart contract, and I want to be able to split between different wallets so that we can do collaboration</strong>. People are saying, &#8216;Oh, well, we can add that in later.' But the fact is if I create something with a smart contract, that's it. It's set on the blockchain and maybe that's 20 years or something, or life of copyright, like, that sets it in stone. And therefore, like any other contract, it means I can't use that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Exactly. And that's why we're saying like, we need some of this figured out now. It's not a wait, we'll figure it out later. I agree, though. And I think too, it's important to recognize that the whole thing with Web 3 is it's decentralized. I don't think there's going to be a single website like an Amazon for book NFTS. I think there are going to be dozens and they might splinter according to genre, they could splinter according to style. I don't know, I'm totally guessing. But I don't think there will be just one, which makes it all the more important to have some of that cross-chain operability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because otherwise, what you don't want to get into is a situation where if I use a real-world example like, I'm only selling this NFT in France and you can only pay it with a euro. And that's it. Like if you want to buy this product in England, you can't because it's only available in France. And that's the analogy I think of with these different blockchains if there's not some sort of omnichain, or way to transact across them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I guess we should say is that we're really moving into a point where <strong>the smart people who are into this stuff are building the architecture of what this will turn into</strong>. So I almost feel like we're seeing what we want and I absolutely expect it will come. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember, years ago, the Kindle first came out in America, and I was like, &#8216;Hey, I want that. Excuse me, I'm in Australia. Can I have that, please?' And they're like, &#8216;No, we're not doing that.' And then they opened up the KDP to Americans. And again, I'm like, &#8216;Hey, can I have that?' And then for years, we didn't have pre-orders, do you remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: We didn't have pre-orders for maybe six years of my indie career, and I was like, &#8216;I just want pre-orders, please, let us have pre-orders. What is the big deal with this?' And then eventually, we got pre-orders and. Like, <strong>all these things do happen. It's just a matter of when they happen</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we're saying, we're not going to wait forever until everything is sorted out, but I'm not doing a drop until at least the financial like, is it a product or is it an asset? This is kind of a basic question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Right. Like, I need to be able to answer to my accountant come tax time. So those are some core questions that need to be answered. And <strong>I'm a bit baffled because I'm like, doesn't somebody know?</strong> Like, there are literally trillions of dollars being exchanged in crypto, like, doesn't somebody know? Like what about, you know, these whales that are buying millions of dollars worth of NFTs? Like, are they paying sales tax, or who is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, it is very complicated. I was actually reading an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b827f5c4-1278-4e36-8c5e-e450a325c16f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article in the &#8216;Financial Times' today about Switzerland</a> because people are like, &#8216;Oh, it'll never go mainstream.' And I'm like, &#8216;It's Switzerland, it's the banking capital of the world.' And Switzerland's a real crypto hub. And they're looking at all these questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that <strong>this is either going to be regulated or banned per market</strong>, right? So I think we're gonna see this by jurisdiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, the amusing thing about it is, how do you even know what jurisdiction you have to pay tax and what some jurisdiction? But you don't know where the wallet holder is, and your wallet could be&#8230;you know, who knows where it is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand the problems with this. But equally, I think we're seeing this in a long-term perspective, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I'm seeing it really, as the next 30 plus years of my career. The fundamentals of what will underpin my business model.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. There might be some people who are plugging their ears right now and don't want to hear this, but this is going to be our business for the coming decades. It's going to operate on this basic technological infrastructure, whether you like it or not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think we're all going to be in a better situation if we're thinking about and learning about this stuff now, as opposed to putting our heads in the sand and pretending like it's not coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. So a couple of things you've mentioned, Discord Server. Now, I just hate that phrase even. It's just terrible. I mean, the word server is just incredibly technical, whereas actually, it's not like a server, it's like a chat room, isn't it really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: It's like a Slack group in that there are different channels. I hate Discord. I hate it. I'm only in them because <strong>that's where these communities are existing for the people in this space right now</strong>. And again, like I don't want to belabor the point, but like, your typical average author or reader doesn't even know what Discord is. And it's a terrible place to build a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And not even that, it's like I didn't join the Discord thing until really only the last six weeks, even though I'd already bought some tokens because I was like, &#8216;I do not need another thing in my life.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna:<strong> I don't want to have another thing to check, like, I really don't</strong>. And I think this is what people feel even if they don't mind the technical side, they're like, &#8216;I don't want something else.' And so, I think that's interesting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will give a shout-out to <a href=\"https://cryptoversalbooks.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cryptoversal Books</a> and I'll link in the show notes, they have a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/cryptoversal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook group for Cryptoversal</a>. Now, they're a new platform. They're looking at what they want to do, but kudos to them for starting a Facebook group and inviting discussion, and sharing things, and answering questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I'm going to link to that in the notes because I'm in that group. And I'm actually enjoying it more than the Discord because I feel like, I know how to use a Facebook group. Whereas the Discord, I go in and it's like, &#8216;Oh,' I just don't like it. So I think you're right. I think that's going to be difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If this is all so exciting, why are people still so overwhelmingly negative about NFTs and blockchain? What resistance are you seeing in your community, and anything we can do about it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: From my perspective, I think it's just <strong>good old-fashioned fear</strong>. I don't think it's more complicated than that, you know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>People don't understand the terminology.</strong> They don't necessarily understand the technology, I still don't understand how cryptocurrency works, and like writing to the block, and proof of stake like, I don't get all that either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there's a legitimate and valid concern that like, I don't understand this and that in two clicks of a button, <strong>I could end up losing all this money</strong>. The media plays stories about people who lost their seed phrase for their wallet, or such and such got hacked and stole X number of Bitcoin. It's no different than what happens in fiat, in the regular banking world and online, but like, it's scary stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think until there are some places where this Web 3 infrastructure is invisible, and people are just on it, sort of like PayPal. I don't know <strong>if you remember when online banking was first becoming a thing. Again, this would have been early to mid-2000s. All the same arguments were there.</strong> &#8216;Someone's going to break into my account, they're going to take all my money, I'm not ever buying anything online, someone will steal my credit card number.' And <strong>now we all transact online without giving it a second thought</strong>. So I think we're eventually going to get there, but it's those same basic fears that I'm hearing now that I heard 20 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I totally agree. And I also think <strong>the gatekeepers, the controllers, are invested in the old ways</strong>. Going back to Royal again, I imagine some people are not that happy that Royal's happening because if musicians just go straight to Royal, essentially you're crowdfunding and sharing in your royalties, I mean, that cuts out a heck of a lot of people in the supply chain of music to fans. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <strong>the same will happen with books. And obviously, we've seen one stage of that with independent publishing.</strong> But the misinformation that we see about indie, and you know, listeners, I'm sure you've seen the misinformation, I still get it all the time. Like, &#8216;Oh, all self-published books are just crap. They're all really terrible and low quality.' I mean, we still get this stuff after, what, 15 years!?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And it's like, yeah, but you know what, <strong>if that's the story you want to believe, then that's fine. You don't have to do anything about it.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel like this area, if you spend a bit of time delving a bit deeper into it, and as we talked about, hopefully we'll have another conversation in a couple of months or something, and we'll just keep talking about this, and hopefully be able to shed some light on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We have to come back to the environmental concerns because I promised that before. So people always say, &#8216;Oh, but NFTs and blockchain are destroying the planet.' So what's your answer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Then stop using email. Because email uses way more resources than crypto does. That's a bit of a flippant answer and I don't mean to be facetious with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in all honesty, yes, there are concerns about environmental impacts. They are real. That is mostly on Ethereum. There are many, many smart people working hard to fix that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ethereum's energy usage will go down 99.95%</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have some blockchains like Solana and Tezos and Avalanche that will have very low gas fees, if any. So I think <strong>that is a problem that will go away, and it shouldn't be something that keeps you from learning about it now</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, you could take any slice of modern living, and you could find an egregious environmental impact from anything, whether from online streaming to email to social media, if you tally it up, the environmental impact from all those, I think they would be far greater than crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And as you said, <strong>there are new blockchains that have a different structure that takes less energy, but also Ethereum is looking to redesign itself to have less of a carbon footprint</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think people are definitely trying to solve all of the problems of environmental impact, not just with blockchain, but with everything else that we do. If you just do some googling around environmental concerns and blockchain, you're going to find lots of detailed information about how that's going to change. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If listeners want to take any action from this, what do you advise?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>J: The minimal action I would advise would be to click on some of the links in your show notes, and <strong>just start taking a look at some of these websites and marketplaces</strong>. And just reading them over, looking at what's on there, and getting familiar with what they are and what they're offering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you want to go one baby step further, <strong>maybe it's not a baby step, but purchase an NFT.</strong> I think that you will learn so much about what they are, and the perceived value, and communities that can go along with them if you buy one. So if you have any intention of creating your own NFT, then buying one would definitely be a smart thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You could just, on social media, have a look at some hashtags. Like on Instagram, I follow #darkNFT. Obviously, I would be doing that! And just some amazing art being created. And I mean, yes, that's visual art. But Instagram is a visual kind of platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what you can do is click through to create websites and see what people are doing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We're creators, we create intellectual property, and we license it, and we please readers with it. But we also make a living and we have a business. So both of us see this as the next phase really, the next phase in what is a very, very exciting time. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess circling right back to when we talked about, is this like 1997 all over again? Well, the internet didn't become the e-commerce and everything we do in 1997. It wasn't even in 2007. I think 2007 when the iPhone launched and when the Kindle launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it took at least another five years. So 2012, definitely things were starting to kick off. That's really when the early ebooks stuff was happening. 2014 podcasting started to make a ton of money. And I obviously started in 2009. <strong>I feel like these things sometimes take a decade. But remember, this isn't year one of blockchain</strong>. J and I surprisingly, are not on the forefront of blockchain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No. I listened to the Kevin Rose podcast today, and his guest was talking about the &#8220;good old days&#8221; of blockchain in 2018. And I was like, &#8216;Wow, this is moving fast.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, yes. So in fact, Simon-Pierre from Bookchain talked about this, is that his business plan was always a decade. And I think he started in 2015. So he's really seeing it to sort of 2025 as when that becomes like, totally mainstream. A bit like&#8230;you mentioned PayPal. Like PayPal, we didn't have PayPal in 2007, right? But we&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: No, I don't think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, I don't think I did. But then by 2017, we all did stuff with PayPal. And you and I pay each other with PayPal. So I mean, this is the thing, I mean, in terms of what I think the action, same as you, is listen to things, listen to podcasts. I've had a look at some of the books, and they are out of date within five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. There's maybe one I would recommend. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3IPN2ih\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The NFT Handbook: How to Create, Sell and Buy Non-Fungible Tokens</a> by Matt Fortnow and Terry QuHarrison. There was a lot of useful stuff in there because it was more about the behavioral aspects of the NFT role as opposed to the technical ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Okay. That's great. Thank you. Right, so where can people find you, and your books, and everything you do online?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J: Yeah. Easiest thing to do is to go to <a href=\"https://www.theauthorlife.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">theauthorlife.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant.

Some metaphors that might help. * Why are we so excited about NFTs? What are the benefits to authors and other Creators? * Why resale of unique digital assets using smart contracts on a blockchain is such a radically new prospect for authors and the publishing industry — and why it could be so exciting for long-term creators who own and control their intellectual property* What are some of the different kinds of NFTs that authors could use — both for fiction and non-fiction? How might AI-generative art and music play a part in that?* Fractionalization of royalty rights and how this is emerging in the music industry through new platform, Royal, where the co-founder is an independent musician, 3LAU and knows what creators want* How we envisage unique digital originals (NFTs) sitting alongside unique physical products like hand-bound books, or vinyl music, and other ideas for how this could introduce so many opportunities for authors to create more in their worlds* Some of the companies emerging in the NFT for book space and our thoughts on what we want to see before we commit to a platform — since smart contracts can represent a long-term commitment.* Open questions about the financial and tax implications of NFTs that we're still investigating* Our recommendations if you're interested in NFTs for books and blockchain   <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n[Please note: We are not financial or legal professionals, and this is not financial or legal advice.

I had a couple of non-fiction books out and a few people on my email list. The international Kindle hadn’t yet launched, print-on-demand was only just emerging as a viable option, there were no digital audiobooks — and there was certainly no empowered indie author movement as we have it today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, self-publishing was mainly done by professional speakers and business-people who had their own distribution channels. Otherwise, <strong>it was considered ‘vanity press,’ and certainly not a viable business option for an author.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2009 really was before the dawn of the Creator Economy — which just shows you how things change over time!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, I had no author friends, and I didn’t really know what I was doing, but I saw podcasting as a way to connect with writers and somehow market my books. I had a one-page business plan on my wall for The Creative Penn with all the different ways I could make money based around my writing. I absolutely intended to leave my job and run a profitable business as an author, but I had no idea what lay ahead. I was just enthusiastic to get started!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"320\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/thecreativepenn_plan.jpg\" alt=\"business plan\" class=\"wp-image-1196\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/thecreativepenn_plan.jpg 320w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/thecreativepenn_plan-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><figcaption>I created this business plan in March 2009</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I started making some money and left my job a few years later in 2011 to focus on the business.

I consider it part of my body of work.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy being a curator of news and although I was feeling burned out for a bit, as I outlined in my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/27/not-quite-the-year-we-hoped-for-review-of-my-2021-creative-business-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2021 round-up</a>, I now feel rejuvenated in my mission of empowering authors with the knowledge they need to thrive, especially as we move toward web 3 and what it might mean for creators over the next few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get into the questions, which I’ve put together from a selection to represent every stage of the writer life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do you balance the artist/writer/creative side with the pragmatic business and marketing side of being an author?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a challenge for every author, and it’s a constant balancing act. No matter whether you’re indie, or traditionally published, there are parts of the author ‘job’ that involve business and marketing tasks. You cannot do without them if you want to sell books and be a successful creative professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love business and I think it’s incredibly creative. We turn our ideas into books that exist in the world — amazing! And making money with my art means I can make more art!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t feel that way about business (yet), then you need to change your attitude. If you embrace the business and marketing side, you will be more successful, whatever that means to you. [Check out my books, <a href=\"http://thecreativepenn.com/makealiving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Make a Living with Your Writing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/businessbook/\">Business for Authors</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/productivitybook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Productivity for Authors</a> for more detail on mindset and practicalities.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In terms of balance, I essentially split my day.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weekday mornings, or anything up to about 2 pm are usually for creative work — which includes first draft writing, editing, research and noodling ideas, recording and editing audiobooks, and also things like this solo show, which is essentially a piece of writing — as I write before I record for these solo shows, and I also write the introduction for every interview show. <strong>Podcasting for me originates in the written word!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Weekday afternoons are for business and marketing tasks</strong> — which include podcast interviews, either for my show or appearing on others; business meetings; email scheduling and replies; scheduling and managing ads; accounting and tax things; organizing research trips; social media (which is a tiny, tiny part of my life now, barely even 15-20 mins a day).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/productivitybook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Productivity-for-Authors.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31185\" width=\"369\" height=\"306\"/></a><figcaption>Want more tips? Check out Productivity for Authors</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I usually work at the weekends, too — but mostly, just an hour or so each day to stay on top of email and business things, as they are relentless! I will also go on longer research trips for my fiction, and also on business conferences to either speak or learn, and then the usual schedule goes out the window!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to have a similar split when I had a day job between 2006 &#8211; 2011. I’d get up at 5 am and write, then go to work, and in the evenings, I worked on the podcast/blog/social media/learning the craft and the business, and everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inevitably, it’s a bit like a see-saw (which I think some Americans call it a teeter-totter which I always find hilarious!). If you stand in the middle and try to stay balanced, <strong>inevitably things shift one way and then you have to change your focus to either side</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I drop everything and just finish writing or editing a book. Other times, I have multiple days of marketing and business in a row. It depends on the stage of each project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that over time, you learn more about your personality (see <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/09/06/strengths-for-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">episode 572 on Strengths for Writers</a>) and what works best for you, plus <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new tools for writers</a> are developed all the time that help save time and effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, <strong>as you make more money, you can invest in freelancers to help you</strong>. Thank you to <a href=\"https://alexandraamor.com/about-alexandra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alexandra Amor</a>, my virtual assistant now for many years! We’re both introverts, so even though we email sometimes multiple times in a work day, we’ve only spoken on Skype a few times and never met in person. Maybe one day! Thanks also to <a href=\"https://www.jdsmith-design.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jane Dixon Smith</a>, my cover designer, who knows me so well now, she pretty much nails every cover first time. I have other freelancers for other things, but those two have been with me for years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of practicalities, <strong>I use Google Calendar to schedule everything</strong> — including my writing time. I block out meetings with myself to write, and turn up as I would to any other professional meeting. The reality is that there is never enough time to do everything, you just have to make time for what’s important for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do you improve your writing craft, both as a beginner and also as a later stage writer?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great question and it gets to the heart of why being an author can be a long-term career. With every book we write, we learn something new, so if you keep stretching yourself, you can keep learning new skills, which keeps the process fresh and interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you can only do that if you write more books. So that’s the first tip! Don’t spend years working on the same book, re-editing over and over again and making endless changes. Sure, you should finish the book and work with a <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/editors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">professional editor</a> to make it the best it can be. But then <strong>write another one, and another, and another, and you will learn something different every time.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-1024x876.jpg\" alt=\"joanna penn writing cafe\" class=\"wp-image-25832\" width=\"444\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-1024x876.jpg 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-300x257.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-768x657.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe.jpg 1468w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" /><figcaption>I like writing in cafes <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The best-loved writers — and the ones making the most money — are often the ones who have a huge backlist and many decades of writing behind them. In the indie world, they are definitely the ones with more books. Sure, there are outliers, but generally, if you want to improve your writing craft, then <strong>write more, work with professional editors to improve your work, publish, and move onto the next book</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>You also need to read a lot and invest in your education</strong>. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I’ve been to a LOT of literary festivals, I’ve paid for courses on writing craft, both in person and online; and I still go on craft courses (although mainly online these days.) I’ve read hundreds of writing craft books, and many thousands of books that I read for pleasure — and of course, I learn from them too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read for at least an hour every day, and listen to audiobooks as well, and I have a reading slot in my weekend for more books. I read 3—5 books a week in different formats and I spend a large proportion of my disposable income on books! I love books!!!!!!!! &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to win a literary prize, I recommend volunteering as a preliminary judge if you’re part of genre fiction organizations, as you can learn a lot from speed-reading and seeing what kind of books make long lists and short lists of awards. <strong>Buy and read the winners and short-listed books and try to figure out what set them apart.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might want to use different <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/editors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">editors</a> over time, especially if you change genres. As your writing matures, you will find you can move to a different level with some targeted feedback on your work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fiction, check out <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G6tgwX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stages of a Fiction Writer by Dean Wesley Smith</a>. It can be brutal, but it seriously helps you target what you need to focus on! </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What services and tools do you use right now for writing and publishing?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a list of everything, including links to editors and book cover designers at <a href=\"http://www.TheCreativePenn.com/tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.TheCreativePenn.com/tools</a>, but here’s an overview. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Tools and resources for authors and writers\" class=\"wp-image-32516\" width=\"471\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-300x169.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-768x432.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I write in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/scrivenersoftware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scrivener</a>. I love it and have used it since book 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I have a finished draft, I print it and hand edit, then put those changes back into Scrivener.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I open the Scrivener project in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/prowritingaid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ProWritingAid</a> and go through edits according to their suggestions (of which I make about 90% of the recommendations). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I print and hand edit once again, but this is usually the only other full edit I do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I export the file to MS Word and import into <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/vellum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vellum</a>, where I format the book. This is particularly important for non-fiction as the formatting is so important for how the book flows. [Vellum is Mac-only. Check out other <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/formatting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">book formatting options here</a>.] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I send the MS Word manuscript to my editor and/or proofreader, depending on what book it is. I have different freelancers for different projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I make the changes directly into Vellum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I export to Word and run it through ProWritingAid one last time, make the final changes to Vellum and then export for publication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decide on categories and keywords with <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/rocket\">PublisherRocket</a> and format the HTML with <a href=\"https://kindlepreneur.com/amazon-book-description-generator/?affiliate=thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kindlepreneur’s free formatting tool</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently publish ebooks direct to Amazon KDP, Kobo Writing Life, and Apple Books, and then I use Draft2Digital and PublishDrive for other stores. (I’m grandfathered into PublishDrive’s previous business model).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use KDP Print and Ingram Spark for paperback, hardback, and large print editions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use ACX for Audible and Findaway Voices for all other stories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am predominantly wide for my books, with a few in KU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also sell direct for ebook and audiobook at <a href=\"http://payhip.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payhip.com/thecreativepenn</a> and I have a <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/selldirecttutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tutorial on selling direct</a> if you’re interested in doing that, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of keeping track of links, I use <a href=\"http://Books2Read.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books2Read.com</a> which has recently been improved with different kinds of print links, and also <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/payhip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Payhip</a>, so I’m just getting all those updated.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some new indie authors might think this takes a lot of work, but I’ve done it all so many times now, it doesn’t take long. Just a few hours to publish once everything is ready. Publishing is easy — writing and marketing are the challenge! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are you doing for marketing fiction and non-fiction now and how has that changed over time?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For Joanna Penn and my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">books for authors</a>, my website gets a lot of traffic based on several thousand articles and podcasts posted since 2008. I have my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Author Blueprint </a>which gets dozens of sign-ups daily and that’s been my call-to-action since day 1, although of course, I update the Blueprint every few months. I actually just did it last week. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-1024x536.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32897\" width=\"438\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Creative Penn Podcast</a>, of course, and that’s brought people into the ecosystem for years now, and the call-to-action is the Blueprint again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">series of non-fiction books</a> with specific author-related metadata, and I now pay a freelander (hired through <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/reedsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reedsy</a>) to manage my Amazon Ads for non-fiction. The books are available in all formats and I narrated most of the audiobooks. I occasionally do Facebook Ads, but not often. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For social media, I have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter @thecreativepenn</a> which I started in 2009 and I use <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buffer</a> to schedule tweets from my content and also other blogs. But social media really is a tiny part of my author life now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s basically it for non-fiction — and except for ads, it’s the same as I have been doing for over a decade. It’s still <strong>content marketing 101. Put useful/interesting/entertaining/inspirational content out for free, attract people to your ecosystem — and especially to your email list — and eventually, they might buy something</strong>. It still works and it’s the foundation of my business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/fiction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"843\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122.png\" alt=\"JFPenn Fiction \" class=\"wp-image-33940\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122.png 843w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122-300x68.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122-768x175.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For my <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">thriller, dark fantasy, and crime fiction as J.F. Penn</a>, I mostly publish books in series, and I’ve just used free first in series, or limited deal promotions on first in series over and over for years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content marketing for fiction is having books (or short stories/novellas) for free that attract people to your other paid books. [I have a <a href=\"https://creative-penn-courses.teachable.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">course on Content Marketing for Fiction</a> if you want more details.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have my email list at <a href=\"http://JFPenn.com/free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JFPenn.com/free</a> and for social media, I have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jfpennauthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram @jfpennauthor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JFPennAuthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook @jfpennauthor</a> but that is mainly for photos, and book launches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have my <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel Podcast and blog</a>, which does attract some readers for my fiction, but mainly I love doing it for inspiration, and at some point, I will publish my travel memoir pilgrimage series.

Even if I got the huge movie deal and never had to work again, I would still write (and probably podcast!) I also want to reach readers with my fiction, and other authors and readers with my non-fiction, so <strong>I just keep putting my creations out in the world in different ways and trust that the right people will find them</strong>. And here we are, all these years later, and it works. It still works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create for the joy of creating, then put your work into the world — consistently, for years — and find a way to reach readers that you can maintain — consistently, for years — and things <em>will</em> happen. They might not be what you expect, but things will happen!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are the different streams of income that you have right now — and how would you like that to change over the next few years?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, I have income from book sales in multiple formats on multiple platforms and also licensing revenue from foreign rights — and I’m always open to licensing deals.

What did your writing situation look like then?</li><li>What writing goals have you achieved in the almost 13 years since then?</li><li>If you haven’t achieved the goals you wanted, then why not?

I had a couple of non-fiction books out and a few people on my email list. The international Kindle hadn’t yet launched, print-on-demand was only just emerging as a viable option, there were no digital audiobooks — and there was certainly no empowered indie author movement as we have it today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, self-publishing was mainly done by professional speakers and business-people who had their own distribution channels. Otherwise, <strong>it was considered ‘vanity press,’ and certainly not a viable business option for an author.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2009 really was before the dawn of the Creator Economy — which just shows you how things change over time!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, I had no author friends, and I didn’t really know what I was doing, but I saw podcasting as a way to connect with writers and somehow market my books. I had a one-page business plan on my wall for The Creative Penn with all the different ways I could make money based around my writing. I absolutely intended to leave my job and run a profitable business as an author, but I had no idea what lay ahead. I was just enthusiastic to get started!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"320\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/thecreativepenn_plan.jpg\" alt=\"business plan\" class=\"wp-image-1196\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/thecreativepenn_plan.jpg 320w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/thecreativepenn_plan-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><figcaption>I created this business plan in March 2009</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I started making some money and left my job a few years later in 2011 to focus on the business.

I consider it part of my body of work.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy being a curator of news and although I was feeling burned out for a bit, as I outlined in my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/27/not-quite-the-year-we-hoped-for-review-of-my-2021-creative-business-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2021 round-up</a>, I now feel rejuvenated in my mission of empowering authors with the knowledge they need to thrive, especially as we move toward web 3 and what it might mean for creators over the next few years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s get into the questions, which I’ve put together from a selection to represent every stage of the writer life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do you balance the artist/writer/creative side with the pragmatic business and marketing side of being an author?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a challenge for every author, and it’s a constant balancing act. No matter whether you’re indie, or traditionally published, there are parts of the author ‘job’ that involve business and marketing tasks. You cannot do without them if you want to sell books and be a successful creative professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love business and I think it’s incredibly creative. We turn our ideas into books that exist in the world — amazing! And making money with my art means I can make more art!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t feel that way about business (yet), then you need to change your attitude. If you embrace the business and marketing side, you will be more successful, whatever that means to you. [Check out my books, <a href=\"http://thecreativepenn.com/makealiving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Make a Living with Your Writing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/businessbook/\">Business for Authors</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/productivitybook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Productivity for Authors</a> for more detail on mindset and practicalities.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In terms of balance, I essentially split my day.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weekday mornings, or anything up to about 2 pm are usually for creative work — which includes first draft writing, editing, research and noodling ideas, recording and editing audiobooks, and also things like this solo show, which is essentially a piece of writing — as I write before I record for these solo shows, and I also write the introduction for every interview show. <strong>Podcasting for me originates in the written word!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Weekday afternoons are for business and marketing tasks</strong> — which include podcast interviews, either for my show or appearing on others; business meetings; email scheduling and replies; scheduling and managing ads; accounting and tax things; organizing research trips; social media (which is a tiny, tiny part of my life now, barely even 15-20 mins a day).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/productivitybook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Productivity-for-Authors.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31185\" width=\"369\" height=\"306\"/></a><figcaption>Want more tips? Check out Productivity for Authors</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I usually work at the weekends, too — but mostly, just an hour or so each day to stay on top of email and business things, as they are relentless! I will also go on longer research trips for my fiction, and also on business conferences to either speak or learn, and then the usual schedule goes out the window!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to have a similar split when I had a day job between 2006 &#8211; 2011. I’d get up at 5 am and write, then go to work, and in the evenings, I worked on the podcast/blog/social media/learning the craft and the business, and everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inevitably, it’s a bit like a see-saw (which I think some Americans call it a teeter-totter which I always find hilarious!). If you stand in the middle and try to stay balanced, <strong>inevitably things shift one way and then you have to change your focus to either side</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I drop everything and just finish writing or editing a book. Other times, I have multiple days of marketing and business in a row. It depends on the stage of each project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that over time, you learn more about your personality (see <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/09/06/strengths-for-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">episode 572 on Strengths for Writers</a>) and what works best for you, plus <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new tools for writers</a> are developed all the time that help save time and effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, <strong>as you make more money, you can invest in freelancers to help you</strong>. Thank you to <a href=\"https://alexandraamor.com/about-alexandra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alexandra Amor</a>, my virtual assistant now for many years! We’re both introverts, so even though we email sometimes multiple times in a work day, we’ve only spoken on Skype a few times and never met in person. Maybe one day! Thanks also to <a href=\"https://www.jdsmith-design.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jane Dixon Smith</a>, my cover designer, who knows me so well now, she pretty much nails every cover first time. I have other freelancers for other things, but those two have been with me for years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of practicalities, <strong>I use Google Calendar to schedule everything</strong> — including my writing time. I block out meetings with myself to write, and turn up as I would to any other professional meeting. The reality is that there is never enough time to do everything, you just have to make time for what’s important for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How do you improve your writing craft, both as a beginner and also as a later stage writer?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great question and it gets to the heart of why being an author can be a long-term career. With every book we write, we learn something new, so if you keep stretching yourself, you can keep learning new skills, which keeps the process fresh and interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you can only do that if you write more books. So that’s the first tip! Don’t spend years working on the same book, re-editing over and over again and making endless changes. Sure, you should finish the book and work with a <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/editors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">professional editor</a> to make it the best it can be. But then <strong>write another one, and another, and another, and you will learn something different every time.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-1024x876.jpg\" alt=\"joanna penn writing cafe\" class=\"wp-image-25832\" width=\"444\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-1024x876.jpg 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-300x257.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe-768x657.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/joannapennwritingcafe.jpg 1468w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" /><figcaption>I like writing in cafes <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The best-loved writers — and the ones making the most money — are often the ones who have a huge backlist and many decades of writing behind them. In the indie world, they are definitely the ones with more books. Sure, there are outliers, but generally, if you want to improve your writing craft, then <strong>write more, work with professional editors to improve your work, publish, and move onto the next book</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>You also need to read a lot and invest in your education</strong>. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I’ve been to a LOT of literary festivals, I’ve paid for courses on writing craft, both in person and online; and I still go on craft courses (although mainly online these days.) I’ve read hundreds of writing craft books, and many thousands of books that I read for pleasure — and of course, I learn from them too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read for at least an hour every day, and listen to audiobooks as well, and I have a reading slot in my weekend for more books. I read 3—5 books a week in different formats and I spend a large proportion of my disposable income on books! I love books!!!!!!!! &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to win a literary prize, I recommend volunteering as a preliminary judge if you’re part of genre fiction organizations, as you can learn a lot from speed-reading and seeing what kind of books make long lists and short lists of awards. <strong>Buy and read the winners and short-listed books and try to figure out what set them apart.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might want to use different <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/editors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">editors</a> over time, especially if you change genres. As your writing matures, you will find you can move to a different level with some targeted feedback on your work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fiction, check out <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3G6tgwX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stages of a Fiction Writer by Dean Wesley Smith</a>. It can be brutal, but it seriously helps you target what you need to focus on! </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What services and tools do you use right now for writing and publishing?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a list of everything, including links to editors and book cover designers at <a href=\"http://www.TheCreativePenn.com/tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.TheCreativePenn.com/tools</a>, but here’s an overview. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Tools and resources for authors and writers\" class=\"wp-image-32516\" width=\"471\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-300x169.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors-768x432.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Toolsforauthors.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I write in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/scrivenersoftware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scrivener</a>. I love it and have used it since book 2. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I have a finished draft, I print it and hand edit, then put those changes back into Scrivener.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I open the Scrivener project in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/prowritingaid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ProWritingAid</a> and go through edits according to their suggestions (of which I make about 90% of the recommendations). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I print and hand edit once again, but this is usually the only other full edit I do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I export the file to MS Word and import into <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/vellum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vellum</a>, where I format the book. This is particularly important for non-fiction as the formatting is so important for how the book flows. [Vellum is Mac-only. Check out other <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/formatting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">book formatting options here</a>.] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I send the MS Word manuscript to my editor and/or proofreader, depending on what book it is. I have different freelancers for different projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I make the changes directly into Vellum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I export to Word and run it through ProWritingAid one last time, make the final changes to Vellum and then export for publication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decide on categories and keywords with <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/rocket\">PublisherRocket</a> and format the HTML with <a href=\"https://kindlepreneur.com/amazon-book-description-generator/?affiliate=thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kindlepreneur’s free formatting tool</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently publish ebooks direct to Amazon KDP, Kobo Writing Life, and Apple Books, and then I use Draft2Digital and PublishDrive for other stores. (I’m grandfathered into PublishDrive’s previous business model).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use KDP Print and Ingram Spark for paperback, hardback, and large print editions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use ACX for Audible and Findaway Voices for all other stories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am predominantly wide for my books, with a few in KU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also sell direct for ebook and audiobook at <a href=\"http://payhip.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payhip.com/thecreativepenn</a> and I have a <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/selldirecttutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tutorial on selling direct</a> if you’re interested in doing that, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of keeping track of links, I use <a href=\"http://Books2Read.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books2Read.com</a> which has recently been improved with different kinds of print links, and also <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/payhip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Payhip</a>, so I’m just getting all those updated.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some new indie authors might think this takes a lot of work, but I’ve done it all so many times now, it doesn’t take long. Just a few hours to publish once everything is ready. Publishing is easy — writing and marketing are the challenge! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are you doing for marketing fiction and non-fiction now and how has that changed over time?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For Joanna Penn and my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">books for authors</a>, my website gets a lot of traffic based on several thousand articles and podcasts posted since 2008. I have my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Author Blueprint </a>which gets dozens of sign-ups daily and that’s been my call-to-action since day 1, although of course, I update the Blueprint every few months. I actually just did it last week. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-1024x536.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32897\" width=\"438\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Author-Blueprint.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Creative Penn Podcast</a>, of course, and that’s brought people into the ecosystem for years now, and the call-to-action is the Blueprint again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">series of non-fiction books</a> with specific author-related metadata, and I now pay a freelander (hired through <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/reedsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reedsy</a>) to manage my Amazon Ads for non-fiction. The books are available in all formats and I narrated most of the audiobooks. I occasionally do Facebook Ads, but not often. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For social media, I have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter @thecreativepenn</a> which I started in 2009 and I use <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Buffer</a> to schedule tweets from my content and also other blogs. But social media really is a tiny part of my author life now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s basically it for non-fiction — and except for ads, it’s the same as I have been doing for over a decade. It’s still <strong>content marketing 101. Put useful/interesting/entertaining/inspirational content out for free, attract people to your ecosystem — and especially to your email list — and eventually, they might buy something</strong>. It still works and it’s the foundation of my business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/fiction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"843\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122.png\" alt=\"JFPenn Fiction \" class=\"wp-image-33940\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122.png 843w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122-300x68.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/JFPennBooks0122-768x175.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For my <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">thriller, dark fantasy, and crime fiction as J.F. Penn</a>, I mostly publish books in series, and I’ve just used free first in series, or limited deal promotions on first in series over and over for years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content marketing for fiction is having books (or short stories/novellas) for free that attract people to your other paid books. [I have a <a href=\"https://creative-penn-courses.teachable.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">course on Content Marketing for Fiction</a> if you want more details.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have my email list at <a href=\"http://JFPenn.com/free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JFPenn.com/free</a> and for social media, I have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jfpennauthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram @jfpennauthor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JFPennAuthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook @jfpennauthor</a> but that is mainly for photos, and book launches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have my <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel Podcast and blog</a>, which does attract some readers for my fiction, but mainly I love doing it for inspiration, and at some point, I will publish my travel memoir pilgrimage series.

But <strong>the focus is always bringing people back into your ecosystem, so you can grow and maintain that relationship over time</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Time in the market matters — for book sales, marketing, brand building, community, all of it.</strong> One reason this podcast continues to attract and retain an audience is because I have been at it for so long.

Even if I got the huge movie deal and never had to work again, I would still write (and probably podcast!) I also want to reach readers with my fiction, and other authors and readers with my non-fiction, so <strong>I just keep putting my creations out in the world in different ways and trust that the right people will find them</strong>.

What did your writing situation look like then?</li><li>What writing goals have you achieved in the almost 13 years since then?</li><li>If you haven’t achieved the goals you wanted, then why not?

I’m doing a solo show today, answering some questions from my recent podcast survey that cover the different aspects of the author life.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n* From episode 1 in March 2009 to episode 600 (Jan 2022)* How do you balance the artist/writer/creative side with the pragmatic business and marketing side of being an author?* How do you improve your writing craft, both as a beginner and also as a later stage writer?* What services and tools do you use right now for writing and publishing?* What are you doing for marketing fiction and non-fiction now and how has that changed over time?* It feels like an impossible job to stand out in such a crowded marketplace with millions of other books, as well as TV and film, games, music and other entertainment options. How do you deal with the mindset of feeling like it’s all pointless sometimes?* What are the different streams of income that you have right now from your author business — and how would you like that to change over the next few years?&nbsp;* Questions for you as we head toward episode 700<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFrom episode 1 to episode 600<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI recorded episode 1 in March 2009 when I lived in Ipswich, just outside Brisbane, Australia. I phoned up a bestselling author on a landline, put it on speakerphone, and held an MP3 recorder next to the phone.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWith some of my early books in 2009 (no longer available in those editions!)<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAt the time, I worked as an IT consultant specializing in accounts payable within an SAP implementation for an international mining company. I had a couple of non-fiction books out and a few people on my email list. The international Kindle hadn’t yet launched, print-on-demand was only just emerging as a viable option, there were no digital audiobooks — and there was certainly no empowered indie author movement as we have it today.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBack then, self-publishing was mainly done by professional speakers and business-people who had their own distribution channels. Otherwise, it was considered ‘vanity press,’ and certainly not a viable business option for an author. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n2009 really was before the dawn of the Creator Economy — which just shows you how things change over time!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIn 2009, I had no author friends, and I didn’t really know what I was doing, but I saw podcasting as a way to connect with writers and somehow market my books. I had a one-page business plan on my wall for The Creative Penn with all the different ways I could make money based around my writing. I absolutely intended to leave my job and run a profitable business as an author, but I had no idea what lay ahead. I was just enthusiastic to get started!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI created this business plan in March 2009<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI started making some money and left my job a few years later in 2011 to focus on the business. I started making six figures in 2015, and then quickly surpassed my old salary with a multi-six-figure annual income, which I’ve sustained since then.

Certainly, I used to hang out in the local library after school, reading all kinds of things. It was a haven of learning, and an escape for a quiet child who loved reading — and still does!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most independent authors want to support libraries</strong> by making our books available in multiple formats for library patrons to borrow, but how can you do that when they seem so hard to reach? Eric Otis Simmons shares his updated tips and resources in this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.eseinc1.com/getting-your-book-into-libraries-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Eric-Otis-Simmons.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33918\" width=\"601\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Eric-Otis-Simmons.png 730w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Eric-Otis-Simmons-300x131.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you haven’t considered libraries as a market for your self-published book(s), you should. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? For one, there are <strong>2.6 million libraries globally</strong><sup>1</sup>, and they spend roughly <strong>$31 billion annually</strong><sup>2</sup>! In the U.S., library expenditures are $14.2 billion a year<sup>2</sup>, and of this amount, <strong>$1.4 billion</strong><sup>1</sup><strong> or 10.2% is spent on books</strong>! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondarily,<strong> the library market is growing!</strong> Two years after Joanna posted my original article, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2019/06/12/book-marketing-how-to-get-your-book-into-libraries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Get Your Book Into Libraries</a>, the number of Academic Libraries worldwide grew to 95,361<sup>1</sup>, a 111.8% increase, and Public Libraries globally grew to 406,834<sup>1</sup>, a 39.4% increase! In the U.S., the number of Academic Libraries had grown 12.5%, and there were 90.5% more Public Libraries! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And third, <strong>libraries are purchasing more eBooks.</strong> According to the American Library Association (ALA), in 2020, OverDrive (a provider of eBooks to Libraries) loaned out more than 289 million eBooks worldwide, a 40 percent increase from 2019, a shift the company attributed to the global pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-300x183.png\" alt=\"Library Expenditures\" class=\"wp-image-33884\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-300x183.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-1024x624.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-768x468.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1.png 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you wonder if libraries buy self-published books, the answer is, “Yes, they do.” </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In its April 5, 2021 article, <a href=\"https://selfpublishingadvice.org/how-library-distribution-works-for-indie-authors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How Library Distribution Works for Indie Authors</a>, the Alliance for Independent Authors (ALLI) shared the results of a 2016 survey conducted by US-based publishing service New Shelves. Per the survey, “… <strong>92 percent of librarians reported that they regularly purchase from self-published authors and small presses.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there still may be some libraries whose Collection Development Policy (the guidelines libraries use when making book purchasing decisions) might state they don’t buy self-published books, those excluding are becoming rarer and rarer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe my situation is a good example. As of this writing, 156 libraries worldwide have acquired 192 copies of my self-published titles since I first introduced them to librarians a few years ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, in the last two years, I haven’t had one library inform me they don’t buy self-published books. And if you’ve heard that it’s hard getting a self-published book into a library, I would say, “It shouldn’t be easy because of the vital role libraries play in societies, but I and others are proof that it can be done.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you bring to the table <strong>a well-written high-quality piece of work that generates Library Patron interest</strong>, the opportunity exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-300x183.png\" alt=\"Library statistics US\" class=\"wp-image-33885\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-300x183.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-1024x624.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-768x468.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2.png 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I often get asked, “How are you getting your self-published books into libraries?” As I shared in the article mentioned above and in my book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35iQinH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Getting Your Book Into Libraries</a>, I’ve learned the best way to inform libraries about my titles is via <strong>email correspondence. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, I tried calling, but invariably I was asked to send information about my book(s). So, after some trial and error, <strong>I developed an email structure intended to provide the type of information a librarian typically seeks or needs</strong> when deciding to add a book to their library’s collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, when corresponding to libraries, you want to answer the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to make them aware of: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>who</strong> you are </li><li><strong>what</strong> your book is about, </li><li><strong>why</strong> you believe their Patrons will be interested in it, </li><li><strong>where</strong> your book fits genre-wise, </li><li><strong>where</strong> they can purchase it, and; </li><li><strong>how</strong> it is doing with other libraries or in the retail marketplace. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also include when the book was released. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have book reviews, you’ll want to be sure they are from sources librarians might use. Per <a href=\"https://libguides.ala.org/marketing-to-libraries/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ALA</a>, these could include Kirkus, Library Journal, New York Times, Publisher’s Weekly, and School Library Journal, to name some. In my experience, it’s unlikely you’ll get much traction, if any, from Amazon, Goodreads, or similar reviews. If you have library references, however, do include them. I’ve found them to be immensely beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: For those that may be new to self-publishing and are interested in marketing their book(s) to libraries, I believe you’ll find my latest book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CBYQKZG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Self Publisher’s Toolkit</a>, beneficial because it contains information on both topics.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Libraries Acquire</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you begin contacting libraries, you want to <strong>make sure your book is available through the purchasing channels they use.</strong> Per ALLI, “Libraries don’t buy directly from publishers or authors, but from distributors.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not uncommon for distributors to work through wholesalers in the Library market. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.blurb.com/professional-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blurb</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bookbaby.com/book-distribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookbaby</a>, which I’m currently not using, can make your books available to libraries through Ingram Content Group (i.e., <a href=\"http://www.ingramspark.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ingram Spark</a>), the world’s largest wholesale book distributor and regarded as the leading source from which libraries purchase books. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, for your paperback book(s), you want to be sure to use Ingram. Approximately 80% of my Public and Academic Library sales have come through them. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To self-publish your book(s) with Ingram, you will need to use their <a href=\"https://www.ingramspark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IngramSpark</a> self-publishing tool. The cost was $49, at this writing, for both a print and eBook. Also, I highly recommend you use their wholesale discount of 55% off the retail price for your book because this pricing level is commonplace in the library sector. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<em>Note from Joanna:</em> If you're a member of the <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/alliance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alliance of Independent Authors</a> or another professional organization, you can get discount codes for Ingram Spark. If you have more than one book to publish, it can be worth joining for the discount code alone, let alone all the other benefits!]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve a comparable royalty for your book(s) similar to what you might receive with Amazon, for example, you may want to increase the price of your book on Ingram to slightly higher than what you are selling it/them for at retail. I’ve found “uplifting” my pricing a little bit has not been an issue, as long as it’s reasonable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other paperback distributors available to you include Amazon, which distributes to libraries via its <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/GQTT4W3T5AYK7L45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Expanded Distribution</a> offering. <strong>While you might get some library sales through Amazon, don’t set your expectations too high</strong>. Only 10% of my library customers have purchased via Expanded Distribution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.baker-taylor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Baker & Taylor</a> (B&T), another library distributor, does not have a self-publishing platform, so you would have to use someone like Bookbaby to make your book(s) available to libraries who might purchase from B&T. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your eBooks, you want to be sure to use distributors that can make your book(s) available through <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OverDrive</a>. With a network of 65,000 libraries and schools in 84 countries, OverDrive states they are the leading digital reading platform for libraries and schools worldwide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distributors that I’ve used to make my eBooks available to libraries through OverDrive include <a href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Draft2Digital</a> (D2D), <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Smashwords</a>, <a href=\"https://www.streetlib.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">StreetLib</a>, and <a href=\"https://publishdrive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PublishDrive</a>. One or more of these companies can also make your book(s) available through Bibliotheca and B&T (Axis 360), from whom I’ve seen libraries purchase eBooks. These four companies’ self-publishing platforms are free. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.midwesttape.com/hoopla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hoopla</a>, an alternative to OverDrive, is another company you will want to use. Out of the distributors I’m currently using, Hoopla is available from D2D, PublishDrive, and Ingram. Hoopla utilizes a Cost Per Checkout (CPC) model, which allows you to get paid roughly 1/10 of the retail price of your eBook each time a library loans it out. Lately, I’ve seen Hoopla-related Library sales almost monthly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<em>Note from Joanna:</em> You can also reach libraries with your audiobooks if you publish wide through <a href=\"http://www.findawayvoices.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FindawayVoices.com</a>, which has a cost-per-checkout model so it's affordable. Personally, I use Draft2Digital for ebooks, Ingram Spark for print, and Findaway Voices for audio to make my books available in all formats to libraries.]</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"782\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33919\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries.png 782w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries-300x44.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries-768x113.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you have scholarly works, I understand <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/publisher-partnerships/gobi-library-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EBSCO</a>, a provider of research databases, e-journals, magazine subscriptions, eBooks, and discovery services to libraries, is a good resource as well. I plan to investigate them further this year for my memoir, which I believe would be a good fit for Academic Libraries’ Social Sciences department.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Email Correspondence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The components of your email correspondence to libraries should include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>A solid introductory paragraph to cause the reader to want to learn more about your book.</li><li>Information promoting your title.&nbsp;</li><li>Your book cover and associated ISBN.</li><li>A synopsis of your book and its genre.</li><li>The distributors through which your book is available.</li><li>A “soft” ask for the business.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If the first five above look familiar, they should because it’s your book’s metadata. The key is to <strong>construct the information in the form of a “Sell Sheet,” </strong>as I call it. Also, if you have book reviews, received an award(s) for your book, have library references, or have made numerous appearances on Amazon’s “Best Sellers” list, you should include that information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your thought process in constructing your email letter should be, “I have one opportunity to impress, so I need to include information that will cause the reader to want to say, Yes!” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you’ve built your letter for emailing, spend time thinking about your email subject line. You want to strive for a message that will cause the recipient to open your email to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Library Contacts “Database”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you will need a list of libraries and the emails of their key decision-makers. I searched Google for this article and found two companies offering lists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One was for 3,108 Public and Academic Libraries for $185 each. You get mailing labels and a data file containing the addresses of the Libraries, so this is not an electronic solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other offered a list of 272,219 U.S. Public and Private Library contacts for $27. I downloaded their sample list, which was underneath a picture of the inside of a Library, and the list contained accounting companies and not Libraries. So, I’m not sure what you might get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use a <a href=\"https://www.eseinc1.com/library-marketing-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Library Contacts “Database,”</a> a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet I created that has been very popular with self-publishers. It contains the names and email addresses of 3,000 to 6,000 librarians who were the highest level decision-makers I could find on their libraries’ websites. Available for Windows and Mac users, the “Database” also has the Libraries’ URLs (Windows version) for faster updating of the librarians’ information if needed, the states the libraries are located in, their consortium affiliation, if any, and other pertinent information. In addition, the “Database” comes with “Getting Your Book Into Libraries” in Kindle and ePub format and a sample Library “Intro Letter” that I have successfully used.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mail Merge</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Various Mail Merge tools are available to help you contact a group of Libraries via email at one time. I use Microsoft Word’s Mail Merge feature and Outlook to correspond to libraries. To keep my emails from looking like spam messages, I insert fields from the Library Contacts “Database” directly into various areas within the body of my correspondence to give the document a “customized” look. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, to keep from inundating librarians, I use portions of the “Database” at a time to do monthly or quarterly email “Campaigns.” This ongoing contact approach allows me to keep my titles in front of libraries consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Steps for Marketing Your Book to Libraries</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Determine your objective for your email campaign. <ul><li>Is it to introduce your book? </li><li>Is it to promote a new book that you just released? </li><li>Are you offering a discount for a limited time to boost your sales? </li><li>Are you trying to capture business during Libraries’ Fiscal Year End(FYE)/Fiscal Year Begin (FYB)?</li></ul></li><li>Decide how you want to utilize your Library Contacts “Database.” For example, you may want to contact all Libraries in a consortium. Or you might want to target a particular state(s).</li><li>Be sure to include your book cover, ISBN, book synopsis, and the distributors through which your book(s) is available.</li><li>Ask, respectfully, that your book be considered for addition to their collection (i.e., the soft “ask for the business” I mentioned earlier).</li><li>Thank the librarian for their time and let them know you look forward to the prospect of your book being added to their collection. I call this a soft “assumptive close.”</li><li>Initiate your email campaign.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I would encourage you to be creative when marketing your book to libraries. For example, when the pandemic was at its peak in 2020, I emailed librarians to make them aware I could help them continue to offer programming (i.e., events) for their Patrons via Zoom video conferencing. Subsequently, I had a library invite me to do a book reading of my memoir, and several others asked me to do “How to Self-Publish” seminars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last bit of advice I would offer is not to give up on your efforts to get your book(s) into libraries. On average, my current library customers received 3.8 emails from me before they purchased. So, while I’ve had over twenty libraries purchase after receiving one email, I’ve had five libraries that I emailed 10-12 times, over two years, before they made a purchase. So, persistence pays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the library market is a viable sector for self-publishers and one worth pursuing. In addition to the prestige that comes with getting your book(s) into a library(s), you also have an opportunity for multiple sales with their branch locations. Also, follow-on sales could occur because data has shown that 42-70%<sup>3</sup> of baby boomers and millennials who checked out a book from a library tend to buy the book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m excited about the opportunity that libraries present, and I sincerely hope you will find them to be a “diamond in the rough!” Here’s wishing you much success in getting your book(s) into libraries, and thank you for your time and interest today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><em>Source: Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</em></li><li><em>Source: Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)</em></li><li>Source: <em>Library Journal Generational Reading Survey 2019</em></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:20% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img width=\"196\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-196x300.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Simmons\" class=\"wp-image-29912 size-medium\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-768x1173.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eseinc1.com/esetomes-books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eric Otis Simmons</a> is the owner of ESE, Inc., a website development firm specializing in creating sites for small businesses, authors, poets, and others seeking to present their personal brand on the Internet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A former college athlete, Eric enjoys sports and public speaking.

Eric Otis Simmons shares his updated tips and resources in this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.eseinc1.com/getting-your-book-into-libraries-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Eric-Otis-Simmons.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33918\" width=\"601\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Eric-Otis-Simmons.png 730w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Eric-Otis-Simmons-300x131.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you haven’t considered libraries as a market for your self-published book(s), you should. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? For one, there are <strong>2.6 million libraries globally</strong><sup>1</sup>, and they spend roughly <strong>$31 billion annually</strong><sup>2</sup>! In the U.S., library expenditures are $14.2 billion a year<sup>2</sup>, and of this amount, <strong>$1.4 billion</strong><sup>1</sup><strong> or 10.2% is spent on books</strong>! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondarily,<strong> the library market is growing!</strong> Two years after Joanna posted my original article, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2019/06/12/book-marketing-how-to-get-your-book-into-libraries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Get Your Book Into Libraries</a>, the number of Academic Libraries worldwide grew to 95,361<sup>1</sup>, a 111.8% increase, and Public Libraries globally grew to 406,834<sup>1</sup>, a 39.4% increase! In the U.S., the number of Academic Libraries had grown 12.5%, and there were 90.5% more Public Libraries! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And third, <strong>libraries are purchasing more eBooks.</strong> According to the American Library Association (ALA), in 2020, OverDrive (a provider of eBooks to Libraries) loaned out more than 289 million eBooks worldwide, a 40 percent increase from 2019, a shift the company attributed to the global pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-300x183.png\" alt=\"Library Expenditures\" class=\"wp-image-33884\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-300x183.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-1024x624.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1-768x468.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-1.png 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you wonder if libraries buy self-published books, the answer is, “Yes, they do.” </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In its April 5, 2021 article, <a href=\"https://selfpublishingadvice.org/how-library-distribution-works-for-indie-authors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How Library Distribution Works for Indie Authors</a>, the Alliance for Independent Authors (ALLI) shared the results of a 2016 survey conducted by US-based publishing service New Shelves. Per the survey, “… <strong>92 percent of librarians reported that they regularly purchase from self-published authors and small presses.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there still may be some libraries whose Collection Development Policy (the guidelines libraries use when making book purchasing decisions) might state they don’t buy self-published books, those excluding are becoming rarer and rarer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe my situation is a good example. As of this writing, 156 libraries worldwide have acquired 192 copies of my self-published titles since I first introduced them to librarians a few years ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, in the last two years, I haven’t had one library inform me they don’t buy self-published books. And if you’ve heard that it’s hard getting a self-published book into a library, I would say, “It shouldn’t be easy because of the vital role libraries play in societies, but I and others are proof that it can be done.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you bring to the table <strong>a well-written high-quality piece of work that generates Library Patron interest</strong>, the opportunity exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-300x183.png\" alt=\"Library statistics US\" class=\"wp-image-33885\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-300x183.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-1024x624.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2-768x468.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Library-Statistics-2.png 1181w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I often get asked, “How are you getting your self-published books into libraries?” As I shared in the article mentioned above and in my book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35iQinH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Getting Your Book Into Libraries</a>, I’ve learned the best way to inform libraries about my titles is via <strong>email correspondence. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, I tried calling, but invariably I was asked to send information about my book(s). So, after some trial and error, <strong>I developed an email structure intended to provide the type of information a librarian typically seeks or needs</strong> when deciding to add a book to their library’s collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, when corresponding to libraries, you want to answer the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to make them aware of: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>who</strong> you are </li><li><strong>what</strong> your book is about, </li><li><strong>why</strong> you believe their Patrons will be interested in it, </li><li><strong>where</strong> your book fits genre-wise, </li><li><strong>where</strong> they can purchase it, and; </li><li><strong>how</strong> it is doing with other libraries or in the retail marketplace. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also include when the book was released. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have book reviews, you’ll want to be sure they are from sources librarians might use. Per <a href=\"https://libguides.ala.org/marketing-to-libraries/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ALA</a>, these could include Kirkus, Library Journal, New York Times, Publisher’s Weekly, and School Library Journal, to name some. In my experience, it’s unlikely you’ll get much traction, if any, from Amazon, Goodreads, or similar reviews. If you have library references, however, do include them. I’ve found them to be immensely beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note: For those that may be new to self-publishing and are interested in marketing their book(s) to libraries, I believe you’ll find my latest book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CBYQKZG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Self Publisher’s Toolkit</a>, beneficial because it contains information on both topics.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Libraries Acquire</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you begin contacting libraries, you want to <strong>make sure your book is available through the purchasing channels they use.</strong> Per ALLI, “Libraries don’t buy directly from publishers or authors, but from distributors.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not uncommon for distributors to work through wholesalers in the Library market. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.blurb.com/professional-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blurb</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bookbaby.com/book-distribution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bookbaby</a>, which I’m currently not using, can make your books available to libraries through Ingram Content Group (i.e., <a href=\"http://www.ingramspark.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ingram Spark</a>), the world’s largest wholesale book distributor and regarded as the leading source from which libraries purchase books. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, for your paperback book(s), you want to be sure to use Ingram. Approximately 80% of my Public and Academic Library sales have come through them. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To self-publish your book(s) with Ingram, you will need to use their <a href=\"https://www.ingramspark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IngramSpark</a> self-publishing tool. The cost was $49, at this writing, for both a print and eBook. Also, I highly recommend you use their wholesale discount of 55% off the retail price for your book because this pricing level is commonplace in the library sector. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<em>Note from Joanna:</em> If you're a member of the <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/alliance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alliance of Independent Authors</a> or another professional organization, you can get discount codes for Ingram Spark. If you have more than one book to publish, it can be worth joining for the discount code alone, let alone all the other benefits!]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve a comparable royalty for your book(s) similar to what you might receive with Amazon, for example, you may want to increase the price of your book on Ingram to slightly higher than what you are selling it/them for at retail. I’ve found “uplifting” my pricing a little bit has not been an issue, as long as it’s reasonable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other paperback distributors available to you include Amazon, which distributes to libraries via its <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/GQTT4W3T5AYK7L45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Expanded Distribution</a> offering. <strong>While you might get some library sales through Amazon, don’t set your expectations too high</strong>. Only 10% of my library customers have purchased via Expanded Distribution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.baker-taylor.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Baker & Taylor</a> (B&T), another library distributor, does not have a self-publishing platform, so you would have to use someone like Bookbaby to make your book(s) available to libraries who might purchase from B&T. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your eBooks, you want to be sure to use distributors that can make your book(s) available through <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OverDrive</a>. With a network of 65,000 libraries and schools in 84 countries, OverDrive states they are the leading digital reading platform for libraries and schools worldwide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Distributors that I’ve used to make my eBooks available to libraries through OverDrive include <a href=\"https://www.draft2digital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Draft2Digital</a> (D2D), <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Smashwords</a>, <a href=\"https://www.streetlib.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">StreetLib</a>, and <a href=\"https://publishdrive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PublishDrive</a>. One or more of these companies can also make your book(s) available through Bibliotheca and B&T (Axis 360), from whom I’ve seen libraries purchase eBooks. These four companies’ self-publishing platforms are free. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.midwesttape.com/hoopla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hoopla</a>, an alternative to OverDrive, is another company you will want to use. Out of the distributors I’m currently using, Hoopla is available from D2D, PublishDrive, and Ingram. Hoopla utilizes a Cost Per Checkout (CPC) model, which allows you to get paid roughly 1/10 of the retail price of your eBook each time a library loans it out. Lately, I’ve seen Hoopla-related Library sales almost monthly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<em>Note from Joanna:</em> You can also reach libraries with your audiobooks if you publish wide through <a href=\"http://www.findawayvoices.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FindawayVoices.com</a>, which has a cost-per-checkout model so it's affordable. Personally, I use Draft2Digital for ebooks, Ingram Spark for print, and Findaway Voices for audio to make my books available in all formats to libraries.]</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"782\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33919\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries.png 782w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries-300x44.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/selfpublishing-services-for-libraries-768x113.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you have scholarly works, I understand <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/publisher-partnerships/gobi-library-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EBSCO</a>, a provider of research databases, e-journals, magazine subscriptions, eBooks, and discovery services to libraries, is a good resource as well. I plan to investigate them further this year for my memoir, which I believe would be a good fit for Academic Libraries’ Social Sciences department.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Email Correspondence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The components of your email correspondence to libraries should include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>A solid introductory paragraph to cause the reader to want to learn more about your book.</li><li>Information promoting your title.&nbsp;</li><li>Your book cover and associated ISBN.</li><li>A synopsis of your book and its genre.</li><li>The distributors through which your book is available.</li><li>A “soft” ask for the business.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If the first five above look familiar, they should because it’s your book’s metadata.

Also, if you have book reviews, received an award(s) for your book, have library references, or have made numerous appearances on Amazon’s “Best Sellers” list, you should include that information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your thought process in constructing your email letter should be, “I have one opportunity to impress, so I need to include information that will cause the reader to want to say, Yes!” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you’ve built your letter for emailing, spend time thinking about your email subject line. You want to strive for a message that will cause the recipient to open your email to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Library Contacts “Database”</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you will need a list of libraries and the emails of their key decision-makers. I searched Google for this article and found two companies offering lists. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One was for 3,108 Public and Academic Libraries for $185 each. You get mailing labels and a data file containing the addresses of the Libraries, so this is not an electronic solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other offered a list of 272,219 U.S. Public and Private Library contacts for $27. I downloaded their sample list, which was underneath a picture of the inside of a Library, and the list contained accounting companies and not Libraries. So, I’m not sure what you might get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use a <a href=\"https://www.eseinc1.com/library-marketing-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Library Contacts “Database,”</a> a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet I created that has been very popular with self-publishers. It contains the names and email addresses of 3,000 to 6,000 librarians who were the highest level decision-makers I could find on their libraries’ websites. Available for Windows and Mac users, the “Database” also has the Libraries’ URLs (Windows version) for faster updating of the librarians’ information if needed, the states the libraries are located in, their consortium affiliation, if any, and other pertinent information. In addition, the “Database” comes with “Getting Your Book Into Libraries” in Kindle and ePub format and a sample Library “Intro Letter” that I have successfully used.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Mail Merge</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Various Mail Merge tools are available to help you contact a group of Libraries via email at one time. I use Microsoft Word’s Mail Merge feature and Outlook to correspond to libraries. To keep my emails from looking like spam messages, I insert fields from the Library Contacts “Database” directly into various areas within the body of my correspondence to give the document a “customized” look. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, to keep from inundating librarians, I use portions of the “Database” at a time to do monthly or quarterly email “Campaigns.” This ongoing contact approach allows me to keep my titles in front of libraries consistently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Steps for Marketing Your Book to Libraries</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Determine your objective for your email campaign. <ul><li>Is it to introduce your book? </li><li>Is it to promote a new book that you just released? </li><li>Are you offering a discount for a limited time to boost your sales? </li><li>Are you trying to capture business during Libraries’ Fiscal Year End(FYE)/Fiscal Year Begin (FYB)?</li></ul></li><li>Decide how you want to utilize your Library Contacts “Database.” For example, you may want to contact all Libraries in a consortium. Or you might want to target a particular state(s).</li><li>Be sure to include your book cover, ISBN, book synopsis, and the distributors through which your book(s) is available.</li><li>Ask, respectfully, that your book be considered for addition to their collection (i.e., the soft “ask for the business” I mentioned earlier).</li><li>Thank the librarian for their time and let them know you look forward to the prospect of your book being added to their collection. I call this a soft “assumptive close.”</li><li>Initiate your email campaign.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I would encourage you to be creative when marketing your book to libraries. For example, when the pandemic was at its peak in 2020, I emailed librarians to make them aware I could help them continue to offer programming (i.e., events) for their Patrons via Zoom video conferencing. Subsequently, I had a library invite me to do a book reading of my memoir, and several others asked me to do “How to Self-Publish” seminars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last bit of advice I would offer is not to give up on your efforts to get your book(s) into libraries. On average, my current library customers received 3.8 emails from me before they purchased. So, while I’ve had over twenty libraries purchase after receiving one email, I’ve had five libraries that I emailed 10-12 times, over two years, before they made a purchase. So, persistence pays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, the library market is a viable sector for self-publishers and one worth pursuing. In addition to the prestige that comes with getting your book(s) into a library(s), you also have an opportunity for multiple sales with their branch locations. Also, follow-on sales could occur because data has shown that 42-70%<sup>3</sup> of baby boomers and millennials who checked out a book from a library tend to buy the book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m excited about the opportunity that libraries present, and I sincerely hope you will find them to be a “diamond in the rough!” Here’s wishing you much success in getting your book(s) into libraries, and thank you for your time and interest today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Endnotes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><em>Source: Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</em></li><li><em>Source: Online Computer Library Center (OCLC)</em></li><li>Source: <em>Library Journal Generational Reading Survey 2019</em></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:20% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img width=\"196\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-196x300.jpg\" alt=\"Eric Simmons\" class=\"wp-image-29912 size-medium\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-196x300.jpg 196w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-768x1173.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eric-Simmons-Photo.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eseinc1.com/esetomes-books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eric Otis Simmons</a> is the owner of ESE, Inc., a website development firm specializing in creating sites for small businesses, authors, poets, and others seeking to present their personal brand on the Internet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A former college athlete, Eric enjoys sports and public speaking.

Today, we're talking about <em>Take Back Your Book: An Author's Guide to Rights Reversion and Publishing on Your Own Terms</em>. Welcome, Katlyn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Thank you so much for having me, Joanna.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm excited to talk about this topic. It is a fantastic book, so much in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a bit more about you and how you got into writing and publishing.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Absolutely. So I am one of those authors who had that storyteller bug from day one. As a child, I tended to focus a lot more on movies and television. I was very much into acting and screenwriting. And as much as my family has always supported my hobbies, <strong>I was encouraged to get a &#8216;real job.' </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really good at math and science. So<strong> I went to school for forensic science</strong>. I didn't really do a lot of reading or writing when I hit my college years. After I graduated, there was that big YA boom with <em>Twilight</em> and all these fantasy books and I started following these authors on Twitter. And I realized that a lot of them had full-time jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, <strong>I was always of the mindset that writing had to be a full-time job</strong>, so I never thought I could really do it for myself while I had a job. So after that I had the bug hit me again and I was so excited and this time I went to novels because I was really inspired by all of these authors who were working and also writing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>YA wasn't a thing when I was a child at that age. <strong>I started writing my own YA books</strong> and I wrote in the mornings and the evenings, and I participated in NaNoWriMo for many years, and then in 2012, I submitted my first book to Karina UK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a new digital-first imprint with Harlequin and they were taking unagented submission. So I am an author who's never had an agent. I submitted and <strong>I actually got a deal for a trilogy</strong> and then the rest is history at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, it's interesting too that you said you had a day job. What was your day job?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I actually worked in a fertility laboratory for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, wow. And you have a background in forensic science. Have you used that science background in your writing at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I think I use more of the mindset of fertility, but as I'm going into thrillers and everything, I find that absolute love for solving cases and solving mysteries is definitely starting to come back. So I definitely use that in my writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: And then also being a ghostwriter with so many novels, how did you get into that as well?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: When I had my child, I was home for a bit. I was very lucky to be able to stay home. And after about three months, I really wanted to start writing again. I was in between contracts at that moment and a friend of mine was talking about how she was a ghostwriter and I was like, &#8216;Oh, what's that?' And I got into it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I mostly worked on upwork.com. It's a freelance website. I started off with very poor-paying jobs, but they were very generous with five-star reviews. And so I was able to build myself up to that point and then I had <strong>for about a couple of years, I had two consistent clients and then I also did work with a packaging company as well.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, I really wanted to just write my own books. I was heading back into working full-time outside of writing. So that's where I ended up and <strong>I had a lot of fun with it and I learned so much.</strong> But definitely, right now, I've just been leaning on writing my own books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's always interesting to hear from ghostwriters as well. I think <strong>so many people don't understand how big a part of the industry it actually is. And like you mentioned, book packaging companies</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't have any issue with any of these business models and of course, the <strong>book packagers come up with an idea, then they find someone to write it.</strong> I know some people who write stuff in that kind of model and it's interesting. It's work for hire, like you said, you were at home and you wanted some work and so that worked for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to the book, <em>Take Back Your Book</em>, so why write this book? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In your publishing experience, why did you want to write Take Back Your Book?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Rights reversion came out of a need to figure it out for myself. When I was about to have my rights reverted or I was talking to a couple of friends about it when my books had been out for a little while, I did some research on what authors do after reversion and I really couldn't find any information outside of blog posts, but they were years past and it was mostly about the process of rights reversion. So I found my way through the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I leaned a lot on self-publishing models because obviously <strong>once your book is reverted, usually I would say 99% of the time, you cannot get another publishing deal with that book</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I definitely leaned a lot on the self-publishing model with that and then it's one of those lightning bolt moments with this book specifically that I was like, &#8216;Why don't I just write a book for other people?' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I had spoken to a lot of authors who were going through the process or had been through the process and no one was really talking about it. And I was like, &#8216;Well, why don't I just write something out? I've done YouTube for a couple of years, so I'm used to giving that sort of non-fiction publishing advice.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so <strong>I just figured I would write about my journey</strong> and in the hopes that maybe it would help someone else if they were in a situation where they're like, &#8216;Okay. I can get my book rights reverted. What do I do now?' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Fantastic. So before we get into the detail, we should just say this is not legal advice. <strong>We are not attorneys, or lawyers, or agents, or anyone with any qualifications in this area</strong>. So this is just our opinion and experience through learning this area. I just wanted to make that very clear upfront. So let's get into it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You've mentioned rights reversion, but we should probably define it. What is rights reversion and/or when rights are reverted?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: This is just my experience as an author. So, again, I would always advise someone to talk to a lawyer or an agent about this stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rights reversion is a clause in a literary contract that allows authors to work with their publisher to regain some or all of their book rights after certain conditions are met. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So this can vary widely when it comes to different contracts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the clause may read seven years after publication, if this work is selling less than 250 units over the last three royalty periods, the author has the opportunity to ask for those book rights back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I just want to make it clear also, for many <strong>indie authors, we also sign contracts when we agree to terms and conditions</strong>. So rights reversion also applies if you are an independent author. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, ACX has their seven years exclusivity contract which many authors have signed. I signed because they were the only option seven years ago and now I'm going through getting those rights back from ACX Exclusive in order to go wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even on a smaller scale, the Kindle Unlimited 90-day period, that is essentially a contract of exclusivity for 90 days and if you don't uncheck the checkbox, you stay in there. So I think there are lots of different ways that rights can be reverted now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It can be automatic like the KU checkbox, but generally, you actually have to ask for reversion, don't you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes. And that can be <strong>as simple as a letter or an email</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience is that it was all digital. It was all over email because my publisher's in the UK and <strong>I just stated the terms of the contract and I asked for the book rights back and they gave me, so far, my debut trilogy back</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Right. And obviously, you've talked to a lot of people about this. We both know authors who've done this. Is it always that simple or are there often problems?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I have not experienced any problems. One of the authors that I did interview for the book did experience a bit of a problem. And I have heard horror stories of authors having to hire lawyers to deal with this and publishers not getting back to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say the majority of the time it's pretty simple, but there are those instances and that's always why I advise authors to really, really consider all the options when they are signing contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I think that's important. <strong>It's best to sort it out upfront before you sign a contract </strong>because otherwise it can be a lot more difficult later in the process and you might have signed away things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned there before a clause that might be in a contract. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are there any other clauses to look out for or to add if they're not there?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I've had four contracts total with this publisher and the first two contracts, I  took on my own. I was very naive in that sense where I just figured, &#8216;Oh, this is a boilerplate contract. Here. Let me sign it.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I did hire lawyers for each of the other ones and really <strong>the clause that they focused on a lot was the option clause. That basically gives your publisher that you're working with the first look at your next project.</strong> So this is where a publisher can, like in the worst-case scenario, not allow you to publish outside of their imprint ever again, but that's usually not the norm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to option causes, I always talk to other authors who ask me questions about, so <strong>try to make them as narrow as possible in terms of genre, timeline, and submission</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes to genre, if you're writing, say adult thrillers, you may want to narrow that language a little bit to say, &#8216;You have the option to read my next adult thriller.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to go off and write women's fiction or middle-grade books or anything like that, you're not beholden to the publisher for that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the timeline, sometimes there is not a timeline specified and sometimes there is. I always advise to <strong>try to have a narrow window of time</strong>. So say you don't want them to consider the book for two years because then you can't do anything with that book for two years until they say yes or no. I would recommend the smaller the window, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then when it comes to submission, that's more of talking about what to submit. Some publishers may request a full manuscript submitted versus a proposal and sample chapters. I would always try to get the second option of just the proposal and the sample chapters if you can because personally, I never really liked the idea of drafting an entire novel without the promise of getting it sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you can't get that removed&#8230; I know it's very difficult to get that clause removed just based on experience I've had in speaking with other authors. I would just try to narrow it as much as you can in those terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And so that's the option clause, but I think even just the basic clauses around what they are going to publish. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In terms of the format, we're not signing &#8220;all formats existing now and to be invented,&#8221; which is a clause. And also by territory. So it will be much easier to get things back if you don't sign bad contracts to begin with. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned 250 units sold. It's much easier to sell 250 units across the whole world versus say the USA or the UK or in or Australia, for example. So <strong>specifying the country where they're publishing can really help</strong> because then you can prove things more easily. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also the <strong>time limits for either the whole contract or if they don't exercise the rights</strong>. For example, we have a lot of authors who've signed away audiobook rights and then the publisher hasn't made the audiobook. So if you have something in there that says the publisher has the audiobook rights for two years and if they don't make the audiobook, the rights revert, for example. Those things that are controlling the scope of what they've licensed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Exactly. And in terms of rights reversion too, I have only really focused on asking for all of the book rights back at once, but <strong>I've heard success stories of agents and authors asking for, like you said, audiobooks after two years and they were granted because say the ebook and the paperback we're selling really well but the author wanted to go out and sell rights for their audiobook</strong>. I've seen that happen as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. So, yes, <strong>be aware of what you're signing upfront</strong>. And then so an author has signed a contract like you, they've licensed the books, they want to get out of it. You mentioned sending an email and then maybe getting a lawyer or attorney letter if necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are there any other steps that people need to do in order to progress their rights reversion?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: You're sort of at their mercy at that point once you send that letter out, just getting it to the publisher and trying to exercise that time limit, that's usually set within the reversion clause. So <strong>say they have 90 days to consider your request, make sure you follow up in 90 days</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do that probably solo for a little bit, but <strong>when it comes to escalating it a little bit if they're not getting back to you or unwilling, definitely look into a lawyer</strong>. And as always, if you have an agent, that would be the first person to go to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Although, of course, we have to remember that a lot of agents get their money from working with publishers. So agents do have certain vested interests in things that an author might have a different view on. So it's always important to decide on your own career choices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you're exactly right about following up in terms of, <strong>if no one responds, you set a reminder on your calendar</strong> or whatever to just keep following up; be the squeaky wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Exactly. You're in every right to be asking for this. So if you were a year in the contract and it states seven years, I wouldn't follow up about rights reversion. But <strong>if it's been 7, 8, 9 years and you want your book rights back and they're not selling it anymore, you really have to step forward and try to get these rights back for yourself </strong>so that this book doesn't have to die on the shelves, you can take control over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: How does an author know that they actually have their rights back and what does that reversion include?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: That letter or email has really been that touchpoint when it comes to determining if you have the rights back. Be sure, if you get one, save it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there's instances of some authors who have tried to republish on Amazon and <strong>Amazon may say, &#8216;You don't own the rights to this.' They need proof. </strong>So make sure you always have that proof available to you for that. I would say just having that evidence is really all you need as far as my knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. That's a really good point because <strong>an author might have an email from a publisher that says, &#8216;Your rights are reverted for this book,'</strong> and then they go onto Amazon, or whatever, or Kobo, or Apple, and there's the book because the rights department is completely separate to the publishing department. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, of course, you can't republish that book until it's been taken down. So it's not just the email necessarily. You might also have to keep following up and actually get it removed, for example. That might also happen. It takes time for these things to disappear off the various stores, doesn't it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: It does. And actually, I did run into that. <strong>One of my books was still available Apple Books months after</strong> and that is one of the mistakes that I made when it came to going through this process, was that <strong>I didn't check all of the links because once it was down from Amazon</strong>, I checked like one or two places and it was down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I definitely would recommend <strong>going to&#8230;it may be tedious, but all of the places that your book was sold before and making sure it's down because they're still technically making money off your book</strong> if they're still up under their publishing house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. So going back to when you get your rights back, I get a lot of emails from people who don't necessarily understand what it actually means. What do authors have the rights to?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Katlyn: Once the rights are reverted, you have the right to take that work and publish it on your own. You basically can do anything you want with it. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can publish it for sale, you can put it on your website. You can do anything like that once the rights are reverted back to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Right. But <strong>it doesn't include the cover, it doesn't include the format, that type of thing</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: No. In most, at least the ones that I've signed and I've spoken to some authors, the contracts, they do have a <strong>sub-clause for reversion that is production files. So those are basically the final files before the book goes up for sale</strong>. The publisher has those. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, I've only seen my book through copy edits. I have not seen it after proof and I have not seen it with formatting. They usually give you the option to purchase those production files and so you can ask afterwards how much that would be and determine whether or not that's in your budget. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally did not purchase mine back. The price for them was just a bit too high and I wanted to save a lot of my money for editing. So <strong>I basically had to go back to the last version of the book that I had and re-edit it in a sense. </strong>And since it had been over eight years since I had published it, I did want to go in there and edit it as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to covers, some authors actually have had their covers given to them whether or not they were just given or they had to pay for it similar to production files. <strong>If you absolutely love your cover, you can ask your publisher for that. But I didn't get any of my covers back. I didn't want them</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had been so many years since publishing and market trends change and everything. So <strong>I would recommend probably starting from scratch</strong> with that if you're not so super excited about your cover and it's not too much to probably purchase back from the publisher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I agree with you. I think most people want to do a re-edit and we should call that maybe a light touch. Some people get obsessed with rewriting, but I think we're at least going back through, even to things like <strong>updating the author bio and the bits where you list your other books and back matter</strong> and all of that type of thing. Definitely a read-through, plus, let's face it, the culture has changed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've been reading a few short stories recently that were published 15 years ago and the culture has very much changed. And some of these stories, I'm like, &#8216;You would not put that out now.' Or you would change things. I think it's a really good idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the cover, as you mentioned, that <strong>a publisher might give an author the cover, but where is the copyright for the artwork</strong>, for example. And that to me is very worrying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you republish that book and it does super, super well, and then <strong>you get an offer from a merchandising company or something like that? You wouldn't have the right contracts in place to actually be able to use that cover.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would agree with you, I think <strong>re-editing, reformatting, getting new cover design. And also, it's a new edition, right</strong>? So you want to put a new cover on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: What happens next? So let's say we've edited, we've got another cover, we've reformatted. What do we need to do next? What else do we need to look out for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: If you have everything ready to go, the process that I went through is I wanted to <strong>determine upfront whether or not I wanted to go wide or exclusive with Amazon</strong>. I had to look at my plans long-term, like through more of a long-term lens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With traditional publishing, it's very, very front-list focused. What's the next thing coming out? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But now, having my books back, it's opened up so many doors for me, so I can do whatever I want with the rest of my books, forever. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I definitely would recommend thinking about each book individually and seeing how you want to market it, how you want to publish it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that too, just another tip that I thought of with republishing is that with a lot of promotions they look at reviews, the amount of reviews you have, and one thing you can do with republishing your book, is <strong>make sure you save your ASIN number, that's the Amazon book number</strong> and&#8230;or the ASIN number's included. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can actually <strong>ask Amazon once your book is republished again, to add those reviews back from the original edition</strong>, which I found very interesting. So when I republished my first reverted book, I had a lot of nice reviews already there from previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's good. Did you just go through to KDP help or something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I went through Author Central and they were able to <strong>link the reviews from the old edition to the new one.</strong> I would caution that if this was a book that you're really not proud of and then you did a lot of editing, do you want those reviews, if they were like mostly negative or mostly lukewarm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's something that authors can take into consideration, but definitely try to save that number from when your publisher published the book so that you're able to link them once you republish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And because obviously, emails go out automatically on various services when an author publishes a new book, but this isn't a new book and your readers might have already read it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you put a notice in the description that this is not a new book? What do you do to let people know it's a republication?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I put it right in my description. I said that <strong>this was a book originally published in 2013 of the same name.</strong> I would say that if you changed your title, that you probably would want to of put some sort of note either in the description or in the beginning of the book just so that maybe people don't think you're trying to trick them into buying the book again if it hasn't changed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if it's changed significantly, that's really up to you, whether or not you want to give that sort of warning, especially too, <strong>if you end up using a pen name</strong> and you just want to put the book out again under that pen name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's a good point, actually. So you mean you've published it with a publisher with one name and now you're going to republish it under another name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Right. Okay. That's interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yeah. I did that with mine. I was <strong>one of those authors who published so many different genres under my name. And so as I came to this, getting my young adult books back, I wanted to start fresh and separate them</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's Katlyn Duncan versus Katie Duncan, but I didn't want to trick anyone or make them feel like I tricked them. So I did put a little one-liner in the description. So hopefully no one feels like I was trying to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: To be honest, a lot of people might want to do that if they're coming back into their career. I know so many authors all who've done it the other way, who've been published under pen names and now want to put it under their real name as such. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How's it working for you having multiple brands? Because I know a lot of people question whether it's worth the hassle like different websites or different email. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you have any issues with managing two brands?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: It's just two for now. This was something that I really considered for a while. I pulled out the pros and cons list, but also too, it's really bothered me over the years that I didn't have separate adult and young adult personas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can go all in, you can do everything separate if you have the time. That's probably &#8216;the best way to do it.' But everything is on my one website. So it all just tracks back to that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a separate Instagram that I started more recently for the Katie Duncan versus Katlyn Duncan. I wanted to pull that audience on their own because I do have a YouTube channel under my name and the nonfiction book and my adult books, I wanted to have them under Katlyn Duncan and then Katie Duncan for all my YA stuff moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's interesting because so much of this rights reversion stuff, you actually have to think about what you want the future to look like this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It's not just a case of, &#8216;Rights are back, upload file.'</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Right. And I'm sure there are people that do that if they're very happy with everything, but <strong>I took it as an opportunity to start over,</strong> in a sense, and just doing the things that I wanted to do based on my years of knowledge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started off, I didn't know much about the publishing industry. And it looked so different too in 2012. So yeah, I took it as an opportunity. I would recommend <strong>if you do have this opportunity, just think about some things that you would do differently </strong>or things that you weren't happy about and just move forward from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I'd also encourage people, if you have a lot of books, yes, it might take a lot of effort to get these rights back, but the money you could potentially make with more books. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it's only one or two, then great, but I know people who've gone back and got 20 or 30 books and then putting those out, yes, again, it might it be some work to get those published, but then <strong>you control them, you can do box sets, which most traditional publishers don't do and there's just so many things you can do</strong>, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes. So many things. And it's just amazing now with self-publishing. It's as much as traditional publishers can do, we can do it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: Are you all in as an indie now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I'm all in. Just with writing this book and reflecting on my career, I'm in it for me and I just want to take part in this awesome community. The authors that I got to know are so great in terms of sharing and everything like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm not saying that traditional authors are not. Please don't misunderstand me, but <strong>I like the idea of sharing and having that backlist mindset</strong> because we spend so long writing our books and then for them to just be like, &#8216;Okay. Your publishing season's over, let's move on to the next.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other ones are forgotten, which doesn't really make so to an author because our books are our books and they're our babies. And so <strong>my mindset is 100% indie right now and I think it would have to be a very, very good deal for me to go back to trad</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's interesting because, of course, your mindset, you said things are quite different to 2012 and your mindset there, <strong>you're very empowered now, you know what you are doing</strong>. But I do feel, with rights reversion, that many authors feel disappointed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>They might be embarrassed, some even ashamed that things didn't work out with their publisher</strong> because some authors are like, &#8216;Oh, it's my fault that I didn't sell enough books, and therefore, this book isn't good enough and there's no point in getting the rights reverted because how would it sell next time?' </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What would you say to authors who don't feel empowered and have these negative thoughts around rights reversion?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: First of all, I would say you're 100% not alone. I felt that way for a very long time, to be honest. We put a lot of ourselves into our books and then you get with a publisher and you hope that they will fulfill their end of the deal for much longer than probably we understand and then <strong>if the book doesn't sell or it's not selling later, it's absolutely devastating</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was definitely in that dark place for a little bit. But as I expanded my network of author friends I realized that this wasn't something that is isolated to that one person, it happens to all of us, and talking about these things with other authors and talking about the good and the bad is very important. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>At the end of the day, we're in charge of how our careers pan out. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we want to make sure that we are educated in that sense of knowing the industry and what the things you can and cannot do. So I would definitely recommend doing your research about the industry and making sure that you have enough people to talk to about all of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's why I'm really glad you wrote this book. There are lots of books on rights now, but I think rights reversion is a very specific thing and you've got some great steps in there. It's very practical. So I do recommend it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it's becoming much more common because authors are becoming more empowered, but equally, what we've seen in the pandemic and the switch to publishers may be starting to appreciate their backlist, <strong>it might be becoming harder for some people to get their intellectual property back</strong>. Have you seen anything change in the last 18 months or so?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I've seen a positive change, as you mentioned, with people talking about things, but I think that because so many people are speaking out, because so many authors are becoming more empowered, I think the trad industry may catch up to that too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm sure they're doing their due diligence as well. They are a business, so that they want to keep authors as much as they can because they're in the business of selling books too. But I would just say the biggest change I've seen is very much <strong>authors speaking out and talking to each other and helping each other out</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Exactly. And also, you can find recommendations for attorneys and lawyers, and people to help take it up a notch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that's the other thing; <strong>go into it as a gentle email, ask nicely, know your rights, know what you've signed, all of that. And then you might have to go up this ladder of taking it to in a more serious way </strong>and certain wording and certain emails and that type of thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's almost like an escalating way to get your rights back, but certainly starting with a nice email. And this is why I think just going back to it, it's that contract that you sign at the beginning. If you sign a good contract, then it shouldn't be difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Many people signed contracts years ago and didn't really know what they signed.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes. And also too, as I said, I did hire lawyers in the past, but I was the one to negotiate. And there is that nice thing you say and then it gets escalated and you have to determine whether or not what you really want, if a particular clause, you want changed or a royalty structure or anything like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You have to figure out what your sticking point is and be prepared sometimes to walk away</strong> with some of these contracts if you don't feel comfortable signing it or you are really sticking in about something. It's scary, but definitely be prepared to walk away if you need to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And that goes for agent contracts too. I was just thinking of, at one point I was offered a contract with an agency and it said we will take 15% of sale of all books published under your name regardless of whether they are self-published or not because we believe we are building your brand. So we get a percentage of all your books. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: That's crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I know. And I'm not going to give any names, obviously, with this pretty high-profile agency with some pretty famous clients. It was one of those situations where I thought, &#8216;Well, I could be the next big-name author if this is what this agency can do.' On the other hand, I'd already been working for like eight years building up my author brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, &#8216;I don't think I can do that.' Just hand over everything to do with my author name. Thinking about it now, maybe I could have started a new author name or something with them, but it's funny, these things come up and as you say, you have to try and take that empowered sense. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Even if you're not feeling very empowered, you have to think, &#8216;I am worth something. Can I negotiate this contract or what should I do?' Really think long-term.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Absolutely. And that's one of the things that's really shifted. As I said, I befriended a lot of self-published authors, a lot of indie authors, and it just seems like the world has opened up so much because it's like, no, you don't just write this book and then it gets forgotten. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do as many things as you want with it. And you have to look very much long term in that sense with your book and not just okay, &#8216;When is the book going to launch? Okay. When is the next book going to come out?' Type of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, good. Well, that's very encouraging and I highly recommend your book <em>Take Back Your Book</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and everything you do you online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: My main hub, the easiest is my website at <a href=\"https://www.katlynduncan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">katlynduncan.com</a>, K-AT-L-Y-N-D-U-N-C-A-N.com. And my YouTube channel and all my socials are on there and all of my books are wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also sell on Payhip, thanks to you, Joanna, for talking about that so much. So I do sell direct through my website and that's really my go-to now when I buy books from you and other authors. I try to see if they sell on their website. So yeah, that's where you can find me mostly, is on my website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant. Well, thanks so much for your time, Katlyn.

Today, we're talking about <em>Take Back Your Book: An Author's Guide to Rights Reversion and Publishing on Your Own Terms</em>. Welcome, Katlyn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Thank you so much for having me, Joanna.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm excited to talk about this topic. It is a fantastic book, so much in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a bit more about you and how you got into writing and publishing.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Absolutely. So I am one of those authors who had that storyteller bug from day one. As a child, I tended to focus a lot more on movies and television. I was very much into acting and screenwriting. And as much as my family has always supported my hobbies, <strong>I was encouraged to get a &#8216;real job.' </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really good at math and science. So<strong> I went to school for forensic science</strong>. I didn't really do a lot of reading or writing when I hit my college years. After I graduated, there was that big YA boom with <em>Twilight</em> and all these fantasy books and I started following these authors on Twitter. And I realized that a lot of them had full-time jobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, <strong>I was always of the mindset that writing had to be a full-time job</strong>, so I never thought I could really do it for myself while I had a job. So after that I had the bug hit me again and I was so excited and this time I went to novels because I was really inspired by all of these authors who were working and also writing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>YA wasn't a thing when I was a child at that age. <strong>I started writing my own YA books</strong> and I wrote in the mornings and the evenings, and I participated in NaNoWriMo for many years, and then in 2012, I submitted my first book to Karina UK. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a new digital-first imprint with Harlequin and they were taking unagented submission. So I am an author who's never had an agent. I submitted and <strong>I actually got a deal for a trilogy</strong> and then the rest is history at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Well, it's interesting too that you said you had a day job. What was your day job?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I actually worked in a fertility laboratory for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, wow. And you have a background in forensic science. Have you used that science background in your writing at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I think I use more of the mindset of fertility, but as I'm going into thrillers and everything, I find that absolute love for solving cases and solving mysteries is definitely starting to come back. So I definitely use that in my writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: And then also being a ghostwriter with so many novels, how did you get into that as well?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: When I had my child, I was home for a bit. I was very lucky to be able to stay home. And after about three months, I really wanted to start writing again. I was in between contracts at that moment and a friend of mine was talking about how she was a ghostwriter and I was like, &#8216;Oh, what's that?' And I got into it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I mostly worked on upwork.com. It's a freelance website. I started off with very poor-paying jobs, but they were very generous with five-star reviews. And so I was able to build myself up to that point and then I had <strong>for about a couple of years, I had two consistent clients and then I also did work with a packaging company as well.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, I really wanted to just write my own books. I was heading back into working full-time outside of writing. So that's where I ended up and <strong>I had a lot of fun with it and I learned so much.</strong> But definitely, right now, I've just been leaning on writing my own books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's always interesting to hear from ghostwriters as well. I think <strong>so many people don't understand how big a part of the industry it actually is. And like you mentioned, book packaging companies</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't have any issue with any of these business models and of course, the <strong>book packagers come up with an idea, then they find someone to write it.</strong> I know some people who write stuff in that kind of model and it's interesting. It's work for hire, like you said, you were at home and you wanted some work and so that worked for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to the book, <em>Take Back Your Book</em>, so why write this book? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In your publishing experience, why did you want to write Take Back Your Book?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Rights reversion came out of a need to figure it out for myself. When I was about to have my rights reverted or I was talking to a couple of friends about it when my books had been out for a little while, I did some research on what authors do after reversion and I really couldn't find any information outside of blog posts, but they were years past and it was mostly about the process of rights reversion. So I found my way through the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I leaned a lot on self-publishing models because obviously <strong>once your book is reverted, usually I would say 99% of the time, you cannot get another publishing deal with that book</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I definitely leaned a lot on the self-publishing model with that and then it's one of those lightning bolt moments with this book specifically that I was like, &#8216;Why don't I just write a book for other people?' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I had spoken to a lot of authors who were going through the process or had been through the process and no one was really talking about it. And I was like, &#8216;Well, why don't I just write something out? I've done YouTube for a couple of years, so I'm used to giving that sort of non-fiction publishing advice.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so <strong>I just figured I would write about my journey</strong> and in the hopes that maybe it would help someone else if they were in a situation where they're like, &#8216;Okay. I can get my book rights reverted. What do I do now?' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Fantastic. So before we get into the detail, we should just say this is not legal advice. <strong>We are not attorneys, or lawyers, or agents, or anyone with any qualifications in this area</strong>. So this is just our opinion and experience through learning this area. I just wanted to make that very clear upfront. So let's get into it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You've mentioned rights reversion, but we should probably define it. What is rights reversion and/or when rights are reverted?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: This is just my experience as an author. So, again, I would always advise someone to talk to a lawyer or an agent about this stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rights reversion is a clause in a literary contract that allows authors to work with their publisher to regain some or all of their book rights after certain conditions are met. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So this can vary widely when it comes to different contracts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the clause may read seven years after publication, if this work is selling less than 250 units over the last three royalty periods, the author has the opportunity to ask for those book rights back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I just want to make it clear also, for many <strong>indie authors, we also sign contracts when we agree to terms and conditions</strong>. So rights reversion also applies if you are an independent author. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, ACX has their seven years exclusivity contract which many authors have signed. I signed because they were the only option seven years ago and now I'm going through getting those rights back from ACX Exclusive in order to go wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even on a smaller scale, the Kindle Unlimited 90-day period, that is essentially a contract of exclusivity for 90 days and if you don't uncheck the checkbox, you stay in there. So I think there are lots of different ways that rights can be reverted now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It can be automatic like the KU checkbox, but generally, you actually have to ask for reversion, don't you?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes. And that can be <strong>as simple as a letter or an email</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience is that it was all digital. It was all over email because my publisher's in the UK and <strong>I just stated the terms of the contract and I asked for the book rights back and they gave me, so far, my debut trilogy back</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Right. And obviously, you've talked to a lot of people about this. We both know authors who've done this. Is it always that simple or are there often problems?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I have not experienced any problems. One of the authors that I did interview for the book did experience a bit of a problem. And I have heard horror stories of authors having to hire lawyers to deal with this and publishers not getting back to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say the majority of the time it's pretty simple, but there are those instances and that's always why I advise authors to really, really consider all the options when they are signing contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I think that's important. <strong>It's best to sort it out upfront before you sign a contract </strong>because otherwise it can be a lot more difficult later in the process and you might have signed away things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned there before a clause that might be in a contract. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are there any other clauses to look out for or to add if they're not there?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I've had four contracts total with this publisher and the first two contracts, I  took on my own. I was very naive in that sense where I just figured, &#8216;Oh, this is a boilerplate contract. Here. Let me sign it.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I did hire lawyers for each of the other ones and really <strong>the clause that they focused on a lot was the option clause. That basically gives your publisher that you're working with the first look at your next project.</strong> So this is where a publisher can, like in the worst-case scenario, not allow you to publish outside of their imprint ever again, but that's usually not the norm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to option causes, I always talk to other authors who ask me questions about, so <strong>try to make them as narrow as possible in terms of genre, timeline, and submission</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes to genre, if you're writing, say adult thrillers, you may want to narrow that language a little bit to say, &#8216;You have the option to read my next adult thriller.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to go off and write women's fiction or middle-grade books or anything like that, you're not beholden to the publisher for that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the timeline, sometimes there is not a timeline specified and sometimes there is. I always advise to <strong>try to have a narrow window of time</strong>. So say you don't want them to consider the book for two years because then you can't do anything with that book for two years until they say yes or no. I would recommend the smaller the window, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then when it comes to submission, that's more of talking about what to submit. Some publishers may request a full manuscript submitted versus a proposal and sample chapters. I would always try to get the second option of just the proposal and the sample chapters if you can because personally, I never really liked the idea of drafting an entire novel without the promise of getting it sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you can't get that removed&#8230; I know it's very difficult to get that clause removed just based on experience I've had in speaking with other authors. I would just try to narrow it as much as you can in those terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And so that's the option clause, but I think even just the basic clauses around what they are going to publish. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In terms of the format, we're not signing &#8220;all formats existing now and to be invented,&#8221; which is a clause. And also by territory. So it will be much easier to get things back if you don't sign bad contracts to begin with. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned 250 units sold. It's much easier to sell 250 units across the whole world versus say the USA or the UK or in or Australia, for example. So <strong>specifying the country where they're publishing can really help</strong> because then you can prove things more easily. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also the <strong>time limits for either the whole contract or if they don't exercise the rights</strong>. For example, we have a lot of authors who've signed away audiobook rights and then the publisher hasn't made the audiobook. So if you have something in there that says the publisher has the audiobook rights for two years and if they don't make the audiobook, the rights revert, for example. Those things that are controlling the scope of what they've licensed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Exactly. And in terms of rights reversion too, I have only really focused on asking for all of the book rights back at once, but <strong>I've heard success stories of agents and authors asking for, like you said, audiobooks after two years and they were granted because say the ebook and the paperback we're selling really well but the author wanted to go out and sell rights for their audiobook</strong>. I've seen that happen as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. So, yes, <strong>be aware of what you're signing upfront</strong>. And then so an author has signed a contract like you, they've licensed the books, they want to get out of it. You mentioned sending an email and then maybe getting a lawyer or attorney letter if necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are there any other steps that people need to do in order to progress their rights reversion?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: You're sort of at their mercy at that point once you send that letter out, just getting it to the publisher and trying to exercise that time limit, that's usually set within the reversion clause. So <strong>say they have 90 days to consider your request, make sure you follow up in 90 days</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do that probably solo for a little bit, but <strong>when it comes to escalating it a little bit if they're not getting back to you or unwilling, definitely look into a lawyer</strong>. And as always, if you have an agent, that would be the first person to go to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Although, of course, we have to remember that a lot of agents get their money from working with publishers. So agents do have certain vested interests in things that an author might have a different view on. So it's always important to decide on your own career choices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you're exactly right about following up in terms of, <strong>if no one responds, you set a reminder on your calendar</strong> or whatever to just keep following up; be the squeaky wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Exactly. You're in every right to be asking for this. So if you were a year in the contract and it states seven years, I wouldn't follow up about rights reversion. But <strong>if it's been 7, 8, 9 years and you want your book rights back and they're not selling it anymore, you really have to step forward and try to get these rights back for yourself </strong>so that this book doesn't have to die on the shelves, you can take control over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: How does an author know that they actually have their rights back and what does that reversion include?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: That letter or email has really been that touchpoint when it comes to determining if you have the rights back. Be sure, if you get one, save it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there's instances of some authors who have tried to republish on Amazon and <strong>Amazon may say, &#8216;You don't own the rights to this.' They need proof. </strong>So make sure you always have that proof available to you for that. I would say just having that evidence is really all you need as far as my knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. That's a really good point because <strong>an author might have an email from a publisher that says, &#8216;Your rights are reverted for this book,'</strong> and then they go onto Amazon, or whatever, or Kobo, or Apple, and there's the book because the rights department is completely separate to the publishing department. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, of course, you can't republish that book until it's been taken down. So it's not just the email necessarily. You might also have to keep following up and actually get it removed, for example. That might also happen. It takes time for these things to disappear off the various stores, doesn't it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: It does. And actually, I did run into that. <strong>One of my books was still available Apple Books months after</strong> and that is one of the mistakes that I made when it came to going through this process, was that <strong>I didn't check all of the links because once it was down from Amazon</strong>, I checked like one or two places and it was down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I definitely would recommend <strong>going to&#8230;it may be tedious, but all of the places that your book was sold before and making sure it's down because they're still technically making money off your book</strong> if they're still up under their publishing house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. So going back to when you get your rights back, I get a lot of emails from people who don't necessarily understand what it actually means. What do authors have the rights to?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Katlyn: Once the rights are reverted, you have the right to take that work and publish it on your own. You basically can do anything you want with it. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can publish it for sale, you can put it on your website. You can do anything like that once the rights are reverted back to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Right. But <strong>it doesn't include the cover, it doesn't include the format, that type of thing</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: No. In most, at least the ones that I've signed and I've spoken to some authors, the contracts, they do have a <strong>sub-clause for reversion that is production files. So those are basically the final files before the book goes up for sale</strong>. The publisher has those. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, I've only seen my book through copy edits. I have not seen it after proof and I have not seen it with formatting. They usually give you the option to purchase those production files and so you can ask afterwards how much that would be and determine whether or not that's in your budget. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally did not purchase mine back. The price for them was just a bit too high and I wanted to save a lot of my money for editing. So <strong>I basically had to go back to the last version of the book that I had and re-edit it in a sense. </strong>And since it had been over eight years since I had published it, I did want to go in there and edit it as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to covers, some authors actually have had their covers given to them whether or not they were just given or they had to pay for it similar to production files. <strong>If you absolutely love your cover, you can ask your publisher for that. But I didn't get any of my covers back. I didn't want them</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had been so many years since publishing and market trends change and everything. So <strong>I would recommend probably starting from scratch</strong> with that if you're not so super excited about your cover and it's not too much to probably purchase back from the publisher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I agree with you. I think most people want to do a re-edit and we should call that maybe a light touch. Some people get obsessed with rewriting, but I think we're at least going back through, even to things like <strong>updating the author bio and the bits where you list your other books and back matter</strong> and all of that type of thing. Definitely a read-through, plus, let's face it, the culture has changed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've been reading a few short stories recently that were published 15 years ago and the culture has very much changed. And some of these stories, I'm like, &#8216;You would not put that out now.' Or you would change things. I think it's a really good idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the cover, as you mentioned, that <strong>a publisher might give an author the cover, but where is the copyright for the artwork</strong>, for example. And that to me is very worrying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you republish that book and it does super, super well, and then <strong>you get an offer from a merchandising company or something like that? You wouldn't have the right contracts in place to actually be able to use that cover.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would agree with you, I think <strong>re-editing, reformatting, getting new cover design. And also, it's a new edition, right</strong>? So you want to put a new cover on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: What happens next? So let's say we've edited, we've got another cover, we've reformatted. What do we need to do next? What else do we need to look out for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: If you have everything ready to go, the process that I went through is I wanted to <strong>determine upfront whether or not I wanted to go wide or exclusive with Amazon</strong>. I had to look at my plans long-term, like through more of a long-term lens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With traditional publishing, it's very, very front-list focused. What's the next thing coming out? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But now, having my books back, it's opened up so many doors for me, so I can do whatever I want with the rest of my books, forever. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I definitely would recommend thinking about each book individually and seeing how you want to market it, how you want to publish it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that too, just another tip that I thought of with republishing is that with a lot of promotions they look at reviews, the amount of reviews you have, and one thing you can do with republishing your book, is <strong>make sure you save your ASIN number, that's the Amazon book number</strong> and&#8230;or the ASIN number's included. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can actually <strong>ask Amazon once your book is republished again, to add those reviews back from the original edition</strong>, which I found very interesting. So when I republished my first reverted book, I had a lot of nice reviews already there from previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's good. Did you just go through to KDP help or something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I went through Author Central and they were able to <strong>link the reviews from the old edition to the new one.</strong> I would caution that if this was a book that you're really not proud of and then you did a lot of editing, do you want those reviews, if they were like mostly negative or mostly lukewarm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's something that authors can take into consideration, but definitely try to save that number from when your publisher published the book so that you're able to link them once you republish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And because obviously, emails go out automatically on various services when an author publishes a new book, but this isn't a new book and your readers might have already read it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you put a notice in the description that this is not a new book? What do you do to let people know it's a republication?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I put it right in my description. I said that <strong>this was a book originally published in 2013 of the same name.</strong> I would say that if you changed your title, that you probably would want to of put some sort of note either in the description or in the beginning of the book just so that maybe people don't think you're trying to trick them into buying the book again if it hasn't changed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if it's changed significantly, that's really up to you, whether or not you want to give that sort of warning, especially too, <strong>if you end up using a pen name</strong> and you just want to put the book out again under that pen name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's a good point, actually. So you mean you've published it with a publisher with one name and now you're going to republish it under another name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Right. Okay. That's interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yeah. I did that with mine. I was <strong>one of those authors who published so many different genres under my name. And so as I came to this, getting my young adult books back, I wanted to start fresh and separate them</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's Katlyn Duncan versus Katie Duncan, but I didn't want to trick anyone or make them feel like I tricked them. So I did put a little one-liner in the description. So hopefully no one feels like I was trying to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: To be honest, a lot of people might want to do that if they're coming back into their career. I know so many authors all who've done it the other way, who've been published under pen names and now want to put it under their real name as such. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How's it working for you having multiple brands? Because I know a lot of people question whether it's worth the hassle like different websites or different email. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you have any issues with managing two brands?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: It's just two for now. This was something that I really considered for a while. I pulled out the pros and cons list, but also too, it's really bothered me over the years that I didn't have separate adult and young adult personas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can go all in, you can do everything separate if you have the time. That's probably &#8216;the best way to do it.' But everything is on my one website. So it all just tracks back to that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a separate Instagram that I started more recently for the Katie Duncan versus Katlyn Duncan. I wanted to pull that audience on their own because I do have a YouTube channel under my name and the nonfiction book and my adult books, I wanted to have them under Katlyn Duncan and then Katie Duncan for all my YA stuff moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's interesting because so much of this rights reversion stuff, you actually have to think about what you want the future to look like this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It's not just a case of, &#8216;Rights are back, upload file.'</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Right. And I'm sure there are people that do that if they're very happy with everything, but <strong>I took it as an opportunity to start over,</strong> in a sense, and just doing the things that I wanted to do based on my years of knowledge. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started off, I didn't know much about the publishing industry. And it looked so different too in 2012. So yeah, I took it as an opportunity. I would recommend <strong>if you do have this opportunity, just think about some things that you would do differently </strong>or things that you weren't happy about and just move forward from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. And I'd also encourage people, if you have a lot of books, yes, it might take a lot of effort to get these rights back, but the money you could potentially make with more books. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it's only one or two, then great, but I know people who've gone back and got 20 or 30 books and then putting those out, yes, again, it might it be some work to get those published, but then <strong>you control them, you can do box sets, which most traditional publishers don't do and there's just so many things you can do</strong>, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes. So many things. And it's just amazing now with self-publishing. It's as much as traditional publishers can do, we can do it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: Are you all in as an indie now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I'm all in. Just with writing this book and reflecting on my career, I'm in it for me and I just want to take part in this awesome community. The authors that I got to know are so great in terms of sharing and everything like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm not saying that traditional authors are not. Please don't misunderstand me, but <strong>I like the idea of sharing and having that backlist mindset</strong> because we spend so long writing our books and then for them to just be like, &#8216;Okay. Your publishing season's over, let's move on to the next.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other ones are forgotten, which doesn't really make so to an author because our books are our books and they're our babies. And so <strong>my mindset is 100% indie right now and I think it would have to be a very, very good deal for me to go back to trad</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's interesting because, of course, your mindset, you said things are quite different to 2012 and your mindset there, <strong>you're very empowered now, you know what you are doing</strong>. But I do feel, with rights reversion, that many authors feel disappointed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>They might be embarrassed, some even ashamed that things didn't work out with their publisher</strong> because some authors are like, &#8216;Oh, it's my fault that I didn't sell enough books, and therefore, this book isn't good enough and there's no point in getting the rights reverted because how would it sell next time?' </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What would you say to authors who don't feel empowered and have these negative thoughts around rights reversion?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: First of all, I would say you're 100% not alone. I felt that way for a very long time, to be honest. We put a lot of ourselves into our books and then you get with a publisher and you hope that they will fulfill their end of the deal for much longer than probably we understand and then <strong>if the book doesn't sell or it's not selling later, it's absolutely devastating</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was definitely in that dark place for a little bit. But as I expanded my network of author friends I realized that this wasn't something that is isolated to that one person, it happens to all of us, and talking about these things with other authors and talking about the good and the bad is very important. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>At the end of the day, we're in charge of how our careers pan out. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we want to make sure that we are educated in that sense of knowing the industry and what the things you can and cannot do. So I would definitely recommend doing your research about the industry and making sure that you have enough people to talk to about all of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That's why I'm really glad you wrote this book. There are lots of books on rights now, but I think rights reversion is a very specific thing and you've got some great steps in there. It's very practical. So I do recommend it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it's becoming much more common because authors are becoming more empowered, but equally, what we've seen in the pandemic and the switch to publishers may be starting to appreciate their backlist, <strong>it might be becoming harder for some people to get their intellectual property back</strong>. Have you seen anything change in the last 18 months or so?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: I've seen a positive change, as you mentioned, with people talking about things, but I think that because so many people are speaking out, because so many authors are becoming more empowered, I think the trad industry may catch up to that too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm sure they're doing their due diligence as well. They are a business, so that they want to keep authors as much as they can because they're in the business of selling books too. But I would just say the biggest change I've seen is very much <strong>authors speaking out and talking to each other and helping each other out</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Exactly. And also, you can find recommendations for attorneys and lawyers, and people to help take it up a notch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that's the other thing; <strong>go into it as a gentle email, ask nicely, know your rights, know what you've signed, all of that. And then you might have to go up this ladder of taking it to in a more serious way </strong>and certain wording and certain emails and that type of thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's almost like an escalating way to get your rights back, but certainly starting with a nice email. And this is why I think just going back to it, it's that contract that you sign at the beginning. If you sign a good contract, then it shouldn't be difficult. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Many people signed contracts years ago and didn't really know what they signed.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Yes. And also too, as I said, I did hire lawyers in the past, but I was the one to negotiate. And there is that nice thing you say and then it gets escalated and you have to determine whether or not what you really want, if a particular clause, you want changed or a royalty structure or anything like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You have to figure out what your sticking point is and be prepared sometimes to walk away</strong> with some of these contracts if you don't feel comfortable signing it or you are really sticking in about something. It's scary, but definitely be prepared to walk away if you need to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And that goes for agent contracts too. I was just thinking of, at one point I was offered a contract with an agency and it said we will take 15% of sale of all books published under your name regardless of whether they are self-published or not because we believe we are building your brand. So we get a percentage of all your books. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: That's crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I know. And I'm not going to give any names, obviously, with this pretty high-profile agency with some pretty famous clients. It was one of those situations where I thought, &#8216;Well, I could be the next big-name author if this is what this agency can do.' On the other hand, I'd already been working for like eight years building up my author brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, &#8216;I don't think I can do that.' Just hand over everything to do with my author name. Thinking about it now, maybe I could have started a new author name or something with them, but it's funny, these things come up and as you say, you have to try and take that empowered sense. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Even if you're not feeling very empowered, you have to think, &#8216;I am worth something. Can I negotiate this contract or what should I do?' Really think long-term.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: Absolutely. And that's one of the things that's really shifted. As I said, I befriended a lot of self-published authors, a lot of indie authors, and it just seems like the world has opened up so much because it's like, no, you don't just write this book and then it gets forgotten. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do as many things as you want with it. And you have to look very much long term in that sense with your book and not just okay, &#8216;When is the book going to launch? Okay. When is the next book going to come out?' Type of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Oh, good. Well, that's very encouraging and I highly recommend your book <em>Take Back Your Book</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and everything you do you online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Katlyn: My main hub, the easiest is my website at <a href=\"https://www.katlynduncan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">katlynduncan.com</a>, K-AT-L-Y-N-D-U-N-C-A-N.com. And my YouTube channel and all my socials are on there and all of my books are wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also sell on Payhip, thanks to you, Joanna, for talking about that so much. So I do sell direct through my website and that's really my go-to now when I buy books from you and other authors. I try to see if they sell on their website. So yeah, that's where you can find me mostly, is on my website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant. Well, thanks so much for your time, Katlyn.

So it's been a while. Welcome to the show, Rishi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Hi. Good to see you. And, yes, it hasn't been a while. We're not going to dwell on how many years precisely, I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I know, it seems crazy. And it's funny because I always ask, my first question is tell us a bit more about you and how you got into writing and publishing. I still want to know that, but it's funny because I feel like I know you from a snapshot in time. And of course, things have moved on for both of us. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us about you and how you got into poetry.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I arrived at college with the intention that I was going to do some form of writing once I'd left, and I just had no real idea of what that might be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran around and did a lot of <strong>student journalism</strong>. I edited the student newspaper, edited the Student Handbook. And then after graduating, did a bit of journalism here and there. And that was fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I found my way into <strong>copywriting for brands and making ads</strong>. That's the thing that really got me interested. That was all pottering along. And then, one day in about 2007, I had a proper Damascene moment in a bookshop in London, just off Oxford Street, where I picked up a book called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3nqjPSQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Ashes for Breakfast</em> by a German poet called Durs Grünbein</a>. I started flicking through it, and <strong>I'd never seen language doing what it was doing on the page</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds really naïve and strange to say that now, but <strong>I'd never read any contemporary poetry until that point.</strong> I didn't know that you could do that with words on a page. I didn't know that you could not go to the right margin, I didn't know that you could leave lots of white spaces everywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought the book there and then. <strong>I was just completely entranced and completely hooked.</strong> I knew right at that moment that that was the thing that I really wanted to write. By the end of that week, I'd signed up for a course at City Lit, a college in London, the introductory to poetry course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's where the journey really started for me. I've been pursuing it and trying to get better as a poet ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Wow, I love that. I love how you said a Damascene moment, the pulling the book out, and <strong>your whole world was transformed. I love that. Because we know books can do that</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said about the words on the page, and you didn't know language could do that on a page. Of course, the <strong>layout on a page is only one aspect of poetry</strong>. So how does that shape the way you write? Are you thinking visually? Or are you thinking sounds? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you think about poetry?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I'm going to give an annoying poet answer, which is, it depends on what you might be doing and what the language is doing at any given moment. Different poets will take a different view on this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it generally always starts with <strong>a combination of a phrase that is doing something unexpected to me, new to me</strong>, and the poem will emerge out of that. The phrase will start to suggest itself, you maybe free write into it, you maybe start to put other things together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, it's arresting, because it's also doing what? <strong>It's doing something that's visual. It's painting an image. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'll give you an example. Last night, I was mucking around with the phrase that was something around like, cardinal reminiscence bump. And, okay, that's just a three-letter word phrase. But you can hear within that there's something interesting sonically going on. And there's something interesting visually there as well. The idea of memory bumping up against itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The poem will emerge out of those twin impulses, the exploration of that phrase, where the sound leads you, where that image leads you. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to get out of the way a bit as well, just in terms of <strong>allow the poem to emerge, see where it comes out</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have that draft, then you can get into more of those issues around, &#8216;Okay, what's it doing on the page? <strong>Is there enough space? Does it need to be condensed up into one unit? Or doesn't need to breathe down the page?</strong> Do I need to give it more space?' You're then into issues and thinking about things like line breaks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do I roll sense over the line? Where do I need to give it space to breathe? All those sorts of things. But it's hard to deconstruct in the moment that you're actually writing it or creating it. You just sort of have to let it happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it's only after that you can then start to go back and go, &#8216;Ah, okay, so this needs to expand out more, this needs to be condensed more.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: So that phrase that you mentioned there, is that something that you heard?Where do you even find these phrases?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: <strong>I'm very magpie-like in terms of how I'm going around the world</strong> and how I'm engaging with stuff that I read and hear. So that particular phrase is probably a misremembering of something that I read in &#8216;The New Yorker' last week, I think, an interview with Wes Anderson, the film director, and he was talking about some of the inspiration behind his new film, &#8216;French Dispatch.' </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Immediately, if something snags, you just have to write it down. Even better if you write it down incorrectly, because you're taking it into a new realm. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It's not necessarily the case that a poem immediately emerges out of that phrase, but the subconscious bit of you is going, &#8216;Ah, there's something interesting there. I don't know what it is. I might not know what it is for 20 years, but I need to have it now.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it's there in my bank of stuff to be revisited later on. I will do that with <strong>headlines, with taglines and ads, with broken bits of commentary</strong> that you might hear in sports matches, and news reports, in people's conversations that you might overhear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Poets are great eavesdroppers</strong>. Never be around a poet for too long because one ear is always on what someone else is saying because you know that there is something of interest going on there. And of course, there's always what we're looking at in and around the world as well. <strong>Trying to find ways of making the familiar unfamiliar, or defamiliarizing it</strong>, making it strange so you can actually get to a deeper or a different truth about it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You mentioned the writing things down. I think writers are similar, whatever form you write in. Obviously, I write novels and short stories, but I write phrases down and lines and quotes in my Things app, which is on my phone. But also I use journals. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where do you write down things? How do you capture those ideas?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Oh, my system is so broken in terms of how it works. Right now, the most immediate thing is I have a little <strong>list app on my phone</strong> and that tends to be the first place where things get scribbled down. If I think that something longer is emerging in the moment, I will move it to the <strong>Notes app on the phone</strong>, and that will have a lot of stuttering first drafts on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <strong>work-in-progress notebook</strong> that always comes around with me and is currently in my jacket pocket. And then for stuff that I know, if I'm not going to do anything with right now, I have a <strong>bright orange notebook, sort of Moleskine type thing,</strong> which sits somewhere. That's my Spark book type thing where all those sorts of errant phrases that don't have a home yet, or ideas just sort of get parked. So that's there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I've got a <strong>drawer in my desk where fragments that could coalesce into bigger ideas, and sketches of poems or sketches of other projects</strong>, they tend to get shoved in there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there's some <strong>weird sort of triage system</strong> that happens as ideas gather along with each other and things will get pulled out the drawer and put to the one side of the desk and <strong>gradually out of all that something bigger starts to cohere together</strong>. I frankly have horrified myself just trying to describe that there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You probably find this too, I'll write all this stuff down. And then so often, what I'm actually working on has no relationship to the stuff I might have written down. And then I might discover, years later, like I discovered the idea for my first novel, which I thought I'd had that idea in 2009. I found it in a journal from around 2003. So <strong>I'd had the idea before, I'd forgotten the idea, and then it had come back in my subconscious somehow</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can we trust that the important things will come back even if we think we've lost them?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I think so. I think it's also a case of trusting that they will come back when the time is right for them to come back and that <strong>you as a writer have sufficient by way of skill, ability, stamina, desire to actually get that idea out there</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm always more worried if it feels like I'm not coming up with ideas. That's when it's like, &#8216;Oh, has the well run dry?' You go through periods like that where nothing is necessarily firing your interest or whatever. But gradually, it does cycle back round. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially for a poet, <strong>planning for a poet is almost an anathema</strong>. I really don't know what the books look like until there's a certain sense that you've nearly got everything that you need. And it can start to <strong>cohere into a bundle that looks like 60, 70 pages that starts to talk, where the poems start to talk to each other</strong>. That's not a rational process at all. That is very much a <strong>subconscious emotional process</strong> more than anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You did just mention about a bit of a worry if you aren't coming up with ideas, and as we speak, we're still in a pandemic, and a lot of people have struggled. I've struggled because I get a lot of ideas from my travels, all my books are about my travels. My well ran quite dry. That was the first time I'd been worried about it really in the last decade. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you deal with those dry periods? How do you kickstart things? Do you actively go looking for stuff?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I think it's slightly a delicate balance of actually is their emotional energy and bandwidth. So a lot of the over the last 18 months, 2 years, it hasn't felt as fertile or productive a time, in part because it's been so busy at my day job. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's not felt that there has been much space for things to leak in, like moving around, <strong>going to different cities is a lot of where my inspiration and observations comes from</strong>. So that has been hard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is always reading to be done. There is always learning from other writers to be done. And so even knowing that, okay, I might not be writing as much right now. But it's a chance to actually catch up on so many great books that have been published over how many years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The more that you read, the more that you will get fired up again</strong> because you're seeing what other people are doing, how they're experimenting, how they're addressing different subject matter. And, again, the process is not direct, but someone will do something and you've launched that away and go, &#8216;Okay, that's an interesting way of attacking that subject' or, &#8216;Okay, that's an interesting way of tweaking that form. I haven't thought of that.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when it's not necessarily coming from you, you know that <strong>reading as your superpower means that you can always get something that will benefit you later on</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. And then, this might be a difficult question, but when do you know when a poem is finished? Because I feel like the tinkering of language is something that poets enjoy so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you know, yes, this poem is finished?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: The cliché being that a <strong>poem is never finished, it's only ever abandoned</strong>. It's different for every poet. I can characterize it no better than you have to have your spidey sense working. And it sounds mystical nonsense to say it, but <strong>the poem will generally tell you when it is finished</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best that I can characterize it as is that <strong>every poem has a certain type of energy</strong>. And what you're trying to do through the drafting process is maintain that energy, and <strong>make sure that the poem achieves what it wants to achieve within the space that you've given it</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is very definitely <strong>a point you will over-tinker,</strong> where you can take out one word too many, add one word too many change a piece of syntax or punctuation, and that energy starts to leak away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's what I'm always looking for. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does it now feel enough on the page to me, or does it still have a liveliness and the spring to it that makes me still want to read it? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And the frustrating thing is, you can't really formulize that. Sometimes it will take 17 drafts to get there. Sometimes you can be done in four, five. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just have to be alive and alert to that. And of course, that's just your judgment. I'm very fortunate to work with a brilliant editor, Jane Commane at Nine Arches Press. You end up relying a lot on that judgment as well because they're coming to it cold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They're not going to be as close to it as you are and so they will be able to see things which are screamingly obvious in terms of that need to be changed that are wrong as well. So the process is never just wholly reliant on you, but it's sort of 90% reliant on you. You have to develop that sense of judgment that the thing is done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You mentioned a bit ago about the 60, 70 pages, which is when you have a collection, I guess, and poems start to talk to each other somehow. I got your poetry collection <em>Ticker-tape</em> and was having a look at that. And obviously, you play with these different forms on the page, I got it as an ebook. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an ebook, <strong>we can't control the look of the page as much as you can in a physical form</strong>. So what's your process of publication, because a lot of people listening are both independent authors, but also have traditional contracts and things like that. And we all do different formats. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does your traditional publishing process work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I've reached the stage in my relationship with Jane where I trust her implicitly in terms of the feedback and the steer that she gives me. So I will always listen to her. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, I will have a <strong>loose idea in my head in terms of a theme, and arc, an idea that a book might want to carry</strong>. And then it's a process of roughly pulling things together that might speak to that. I do that in quite a quick flurry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I email that very rough first manuscript to Jane very hastily, and just basically saying, &#8216;Take it off my hands, I don't want to see it again.' And because <strong>the lead times in poetry are so long and slow,</strong> there's a lot of time for things to basically sit and mature, and wait. So if I give you an indication, we're working on my third book at the moment, and that's not due to come out until 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: We've got a lot of time just to actually <strong>play about with stuff, take poems out, reorder stuff, rewrite.</strong> But we agreed that we're not going to touch it for a year. So the manuscript is just sitting and waiting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we do come to it next year, we're going to attack it with a fresh vigor and come to it cold. That's an indication of just one editorial relationship. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The good thing about poetry, of course, is that, especially now, the means of getting out there, and getting your work out there, and getting to market, are so much more wide and wildly varied than they ever have been. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I work in a relatively traditional manner, directly with an independent publisher based up in Coventry. It's a non-agented relationship, so I was fortunate that I sent Jane some poems and she liked them so much, she wanted to publish the book, which became <em>Ticker-tape</em>, and we've developed the relationship from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of other people that work in different ways that go to the web as their port of call. Of course, self-publishing, maybe using social media as another means, using YouTube as another means of getting work out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How you publish and how you get to market is really ultimately dependent on what it is that you want to achieve,</strong> and what you feel the best form for your poems are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of poets writing, for whom actually a book is not even close to being the end goal because <strong>the poem is the poem and actually standing up performing it, it hitting the air,</strong> <strong>that's the important thing</strong>, and the book is an afterthought. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are poets like me who, because we've come up through what's called <strong>the page tradition, the book is the object has always been the ultimate goal.</strong> We work towards that end instead. So it is sort of dependent on you as a poet to have an idea of what it is that you might want to do, and where you might want to take your work as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Before we started recording, you said about that you do spoken word, and you do go and perform in order to sell books, which I thought was really interesting. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us about the performance side of being a poet.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Especially in British poetry, there's always been this divide between people who've come up through what's called the <strong>page traditions,</strong> or people who've published in magazines, probably, studied creative writing, or English, or something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And people who've come up through what's known as performance of the spoken word, and there's a historic overlay of race and class in that divide</strong> as well, which is probably far too complex to get into right now. Broadly speaking, and this goes back to the poet's route is the traveling troubadour, going round, bringing lyric and song to village as you go around in the middle ages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, even if you're a poet who is much more literary in approach, and bent, and wants to be known for the books, <strong>the number of books that you sell is so much smaller than compared to almost any other type of literature</strong> that is published, that you just cannot rely on publishing a book and it being in bookshops. And that's it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You have to go out and meet people. And you have to go out and read the work. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to go and organize readings, visit book shops, visit poetry nights, basically say yes to whoever will have you. So <strong>you have to learn some skills and some aspects of performance. </strong>Even if you don't call yourself a performance poet, you have to learn those things of being able to project, being able to hold a room, being able to very crudely know how to use a microphone without breaking people's eardrums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a level at which you have to have <strong>some degree of stagecraft, some degree of I know how to construct a setlist</strong>, I know how to take people from A to B, in a given moment, I know how to make 10 minutes of time work, even if you don't think of yourself as someone who is comfortable or natural on stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've certainly found that out of everything, that's been the aspect of craft that I've had to learn the most over the last couple of years, because I'm acutely aware as well that people are coming to our poetry night out of a welter of other entertainment options that they could be doing that night. They could be in watching &#8216;MasterChef' or watching the football or something on Netflix. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that people have chosen to spend time with poets and poetry, <strong>there's an element to which you have to give them a degree of show. </strong>But that doesn't mean that it has to be insubstantial. It can still be deep and serious, but there is that respect that you have to give the audience by turning up and giving your work the respect it deserves as well when it hits the air. So not mumbling, not keeping your eyes down on stage, that sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: Have you learned that through practice and doing things, or have you done courses and things on performance?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: It's mostly through learning as doing it, and sinking, or swimming, whatever it might be. I've done a couple of courses to work on stuff like my breath, and just to feel more comfortable projecting and being able to take control of a stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm also fortunate that as part of <a href=\"https://malikaspoetrykitchen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Malika's Kitchen</a>, that collective, Malika Booker, the founder, Roger Robinson, the other founder, they're two of our great poets, but they're two great performers as well. I've worked with Roger and Malika in the past to actually build up my confidence in terms of how to take hold of the stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a reading that I did maybe getting on for about seven, eight years ago. Malika and Roger were directing that, it was like the soundtrack. That was basically a 2-hour masterclass for me in terms of how to take them and take them on the first stage for a 300 seat audience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the things that Roger told me that day, I still use it when I'm preparing a performance just in terms of keying and <strong>what I need to key into emotionally to be able to then transfer that to the audience. How I need to hold someone's eye in the audience, how I need to find someone to direct the performance to</strong> for the evening, whether it's five minutes, whether it's half an hour, all those things you have to have at least a consideration of. It's definitely something that I've mostly learned on the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had <strong>horror shows. I've had gigs where one person has turned up</strong> and, oh, my goodness, that's a tough night for all of us concerned. I've done my time standing on tables in pubs when the football's been on and tried to get attention that way. <strong>Everyone has to go through that sort of apprenticeship, without fail, and you have to tune into the absurdity of it </strong>and run with it or you don't, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I've always remembered you as someone with good humor, and an ability to laugh. And my memories of you are laughing. It might have been because we were in the bar so often!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yeah, sounds true.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>As serious as poetry is, and as much as it changes lives, and as much as it is an investigation of language doing different things under pressure, there is an inherently absurd aspect to it as well. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course there is, I think, and you have to lean into that a bit. Because very few of us are going to be geniuses at the level of Penny or Hughes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the rest of us who are toiling in their shadows, you might as well enjoy it. Otherwise, why are you doing it? That's not to detract from the seriousness of the work, or the seriousness of what you are saying. But I think as much as <strong>you want to move the audience, you want to also leave them with their hearts a little lighter</strong> as well. I think laughter is a useful tool in your armory to be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. Especially laughing at yourself when things are difficult, which I think we all need to do. You mentioned that obviously performing in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How can poets and other writers embrace the audio and video opportunities available now online? Especially with the pandemic. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you been doing a lot more online stuff in terms of multimedia?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yes. Come March 2020, it was very acute in terms of just the juddering way in which everything moved online. I felt that very much because <strong>my second book was due to come out of the week that we went into lockdown.</strong> So my launch party, all the gigs that I had lined up for that first couple of weeks, all canceled. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If producers were agile enough, some shifted online, but <strong>we were very much feeling our way, and that spirit of experimentation carried through</strong>. So I did things like, on the night of publication, I did a 20-minute set on Twitter via a periscope, just literally holding my phone up and just barking down that to the 50 of people who wanted to just spend Thursday night being shouted out by man in the crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last 18 months has seen iterations of doing that sort of thing. I think you've seen that people very rapidly have found ways of working that worked for them. It's been very <strong>beneficial in terms of accessibility </strong>for people, both in terms of the fact that <strong>you can now provide captions</strong>, and the fact that you can get audiences but also <strong>perform for audiences in a much bigger locale</strong> than you ever could before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've done gigs for American audiences which would have been a lot harder even three years ago, just in terms of not having to travel and so you're suddenly opened up to a different thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performing down the line does bring its own set of challenges. I think <strong>the energy that you need to actually convey the personality that you might want to project down a Zoom call is actually a lot greater than you might anticipate</strong> than if you were in the room. I find online readings actually more draining than offline readings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning how to make the most of the tech on the platform has been hard. Some people are better at it than others, even things like do you actually invest in ring lights? Can you actually make sure that your laptop is set up in the right height so that your eye line is level, as opposed to looking up or looking down? Things like that people have had to learn on the go, and people are getting better at it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The best thing that you can do is, as ever, say yes to stuff, and then work out how to do it as you go along. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And not being scared of this stuff. And just go, ultimately, what's the worst that happens? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You read some poems into a Zoom call, some people send some emoticons and emojis in the chat and then on you go. It's not as scary as it first feels, I think is the main thing. Try and to embrace it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that's great. I do agree with you that I think people didn't realize how much energy you do expend it through a screen because you're still trying to project, in fact, you have to project energy through the screen in the same way that you would in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of people understand that now because people are like, &#8216;Oh, I just can't do Zoom calls all day, it's so tiring.' I feel like &#8216;normal people' in quotation marks now understand this as well as we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yes, absolutely. There's something about most performances happening in different space. So <strong>you're going somewhere, you have that time to prepare, you have that time to get to that headspace</strong>, as opposed to say, in my case, I'm working from my study. And then I maybe have five minutes. I have to try and get into the performance headspace. It's a weird sort of decompression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could do things, again, I think I would be a lot stricter with, okay, if I am performing tonight online, I need to treat it as I would have done a physical gig and so <strong>stopped work earlier</strong> so I have time to decompress from that. I can then build the energy up to do the performance again, as opposed to at 7:00 need to log off the work, email, and jump onto the Zoom call. These are things that we've only discovered as we've had to do them, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, it leads to much more by way of performance opportunities and differing modes of doing things as well. I really do hope that more producers will make <strong>more events hybrid</strong>. I'd love to be able to do <strong>more live in-person readings, but with people dialing in from all different parts of the world</strong> so you actually have this lovely mix of people and voices in the room but elsewhere around the world. That seems like one of the things that we should take away from the last two years that you can expand the possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. You talked about the poetry collection, Malika's Poetry Kitchen. I love this idea of The Writers Collective, which I feel is not so common in perhaps the longer form book space. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us about Malika's Poetry Kitchen and how you work together in a collective.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Malika started Kitchen&#8230;oh, we're celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Collective actually. So that's when the book came out. We've been doing lots of events in the weekend over the last couple of months to celebrate that fact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Malika started writing back in 2000, 2001, one of the things she quickly felt was that <strong>there was a definite lack of support for writers like her who were just starting, but also in particular writers of color</strong> who were just starting as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poetry establishment at the time was very sniffy, very snobby, and had effectively placed poets of color in that box, which is, &#8216;Okay, you are just stand up performers, you're spoken word people, you don't have a sense of craft on the page. We're not particularly that interested in helping you advance what you're writing and how you're writing.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchen started from Malika and Roger wanting to change that, and in a very DIY way, saying, &#8216;Okay, we're going to set up something that means that we can help ourselves.' It started in Malika's house in Brixton. Malika and Roger invited a couple of other poets over who are looking for a similar thing. And it's grown from there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, each week, one of them would organize some sort of workshop exercise where they'd read, they'd work through different poems, they'd bring crafts, they'd workshop those. <strong>From those small roots, it's just grown, and grown, and grown, to the point at which poets from around the world come and give masterclasses</strong> to people in the group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many brilliant poets, who we read now who are <strong>winning awards and prizes</strong> have come through and been members of The Collective at the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's always been a free-floating thing. So you come and you're a member for a bit, and then you move on, or you're sort of a more long-standing member like I might be, eight, nine years or so now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing has always been mutual support. And the idea that we all learn from each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crucially, we're not trying to impose our tastes on each other, or all trying to write in a similar voice. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the book, and when you read the book, you'll see that of the 70 odd poems in that, not one sounds like the other, which is just a testament to the fact that what we're there to do when we round the table, is make everyone's work better, and <strong>help them achieve what they're trying to achieve in the work.</strong> But we're not trying to impose our own aesthetic standards on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through it, people have developed their skills in leading workshops, developing their performance skills, just developing their confidence and their ability to inhabit the position that says, &#8216;I am a writer, I'm a poet,' which is often quite a scary thing for people to actually take on as well. I think there is a part, yeah, and I think why is it that there's more sort of poetry help in that form. I think there is a practical thing here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In two hours, we can get through a lot of work, we can get through a lot of people's poems as opposed to looking at longer pieces over a longer term. I think we have more agility and fluidity when thinking about that, as opposed to thinking about big chunks of pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. You mentioned what the poetry establishment was like back in the early 2000s. Do you think things have changed now? In one way, we see some things changing in some ways. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you feel that the poetry establishment has changed and is more open now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yes, it has. If I give you an example of how dire things were, the Arts Council commissioned Bernadine Evaristo in fact to write a report on the state of British poetry back in 2005. What she found was that only 1% of the collections published in the previous year had been written by writers of color, which was, in terms of representation was just stunning, a stunning fact, just one word, just gobsmacking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since that point, there has been a lot of money and effort put into bringing forward and bringing through writers of color. I've been a beneficiary of some of those schemes, so the cards on the table there. I think there has been over the last 15 years in particular, an acceptance that <strong>if your conception of what passes for poetry in Britain, is one that is very white, middle class, university-educated, you're missing out on the wide richness of what is going on</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the point at which now we're seeing <strong>writers of color winning awards, getting their dues in terms of wider coverage</strong> as well. Roger Robinson winning the T. S. Eliot, a couple of years ago, Malika won the Ford prize for best single poem a couple of years ago, Kayo Chingonyi, being nominated for Forward and T. S. Eliot prizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should stress these aren't just mere tokenistic representations. These are <strong>brilliant pieces of work coming through that are finding their readers</strong>, winning the plaudits, because they are so good. But there is <strong>15 to 20 years of graft that underlies that success, and opening doors, battering down doors</strong> when they won't be opened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say to people now that if you are writing a history of British poetry, you can't tell it credibly now without telling that story of how Black and Asian writers have contributed massively to it over the last 20, 25 years. I'm positive that there has been change. There's always plenty more to be done, but I feel like the trend is going in the right direction, certainly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That is great and good to hear. And that poetry collection is <em>Too Young, Too Loud, Too Different</em> for people that are interested. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us where people can find you and everything you do online.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I mostly live on social media. Twitter is normally the best place to find me because that is where I hang out. And that is where I share most of my stuff. I'm @betarish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write occasionally for &#8216;The Guardian.' So you'll sometimes find me there. A route of doing poetry reviews, I do stuff for &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Rialto' magazine</a>. On occasion, Rialto is one of our best poetry magazines in the UK. So that's always worth a dive in when it comes out, which is three times a year. I'm sometimes lurking on Instagram, but that's mostly cat pictures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: Tell us the names of your books so that people who buy your books can get them.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Oh, well, that's very kind, the invitation to flaunt myself. But yes, as you mentioned, <em>Ticker-tape</em> was my debut and that came out in 2017. And then my second book <em>Saffron Jack</em> came out in March 2020. And they're both published by Nine Arches Press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant. Well, thanks so much for your time, Rishi. That was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Not at all.

So it's been a while. Welcome to the show, Rishi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Hi. Good to see you. And, yes, it hasn't been a while. We're not going to dwell on how many years precisely, I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I know, it seems crazy. And it's funny because I always ask, my first question is tell us a bit more about you and how you got into writing and publishing. I still want to know that, but it's funny because I feel like I know you from a snapshot in time. And of course, things have moved on for both of us. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us about you and how you got into poetry.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I arrived at college with the intention that I was going to do some form of writing once I'd left, and I just had no real idea of what that might be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran around and did a lot of <strong>student journalism</strong>. I edited the student newspaper, edited the Student Handbook. And then after graduating, did a bit of journalism here and there. And that was fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I found my way into <strong>copywriting for brands and making ads</strong>. That's the thing that really got me interested. That was all pottering along. And then, one day in about 2007, I had a proper Damascene moment in a bookshop in London, just off Oxford Street, where I picked up a book called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3nqjPSQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Ashes for Breakfast</em> by a German poet called Durs Grünbein</a>. I started flicking through it, and <strong>I'd never seen language doing what it was doing on the page</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds really naïve and strange to say that now, but <strong>I'd never read any contemporary poetry until that point.</strong> I didn't know that you could do that with words on a page. I didn't know that you could not go to the right margin, I didn't know that you could leave lots of white spaces everywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought the book there and then. <strong>I was just completely entranced and completely hooked.</strong> I knew right at that moment that that was the thing that I really wanted to write. By the end of that week, I'd signed up for a course at City Lit, a college in London, the introductory to poetry course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's where the journey really started for me. I've been pursuing it and trying to get better as a poet ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Wow, I love that. I love how you said a Damascene moment, the pulling the book out, and <strong>your whole world was transformed. I love that. Because we know books can do that</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said about the words on the page, and you didn't know language could do that on a page. Of course, the <strong>layout on a page is only one aspect of poetry</strong>. So how does that shape the way you write? Are you thinking visually? Or are you thinking sounds? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you think about poetry?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I'm going to give an annoying poet answer, which is, it depends on what you might be doing and what the language is doing at any given moment. Different poets will take a different view on this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it generally always starts with <strong>a combination of a phrase that is doing something unexpected to me, new to me</strong>, and the poem will emerge out of that. The phrase will start to suggest itself, you maybe free write into it, you maybe start to put other things together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, it's arresting, because it's also doing what? <strong>It's doing something that's visual. It's painting an image. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'll give you an example. Last night, I was mucking around with the phrase that was something around like, cardinal reminiscence bump. And, okay, that's just a three-letter word phrase. But you can hear within that there's something interesting sonically going on. And there's something interesting visually there as well. The idea of memory bumping up against itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The poem will emerge out of those twin impulses, the exploration of that phrase, where the sound leads you, where that image leads you. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to get out of the way a bit as well, just in terms of <strong>allow the poem to emerge, see where it comes out</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have that draft, then you can get into more of those issues around, &#8216;Okay, what's it doing on the page? <strong>Is there enough space? Does it need to be condensed up into one unit? Or doesn't need to breathe down the page?</strong> Do I need to give it more space?' You're then into issues and thinking about things like line breaks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do I roll sense over the line? Where do I need to give it space to breathe? All those sorts of things. But it's hard to deconstruct in the moment that you're actually writing it or creating it. You just sort of have to let it happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it's only after that you can then start to go back and go, &#8216;Ah, okay, so this needs to expand out more, this needs to be condensed more.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: So that phrase that you mentioned there, is that something that you heard?Where do you even find these phrases?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: <strong>I'm very magpie-like in terms of how I'm going around the world</strong> and how I'm engaging with stuff that I read and hear. So that particular phrase is probably a misremembering of something that I read in &#8216;The New Yorker' last week, I think, an interview with Wes Anderson, the film director, and he was talking about some of the inspiration behind his new film, &#8216;French Dispatch.' </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Immediately, if something snags, you just have to write it down. Even better if you write it down incorrectly, because you're taking it into a new realm. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It's not necessarily the case that a poem immediately emerges out of that phrase, but the subconscious bit of you is going, &#8216;Ah, there's something interesting there. I don't know what it is. I might not know what it is for 20 years, but I need to have it now.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it's there in my bank of stuff to be revisited later on. I will do that with <strong>headlines, with taglines and ads, with broken bits of commentary</strong> that you might hear in sports matches, and news reports, in people's conversations that you might overhear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Poets are great eavesdroppers</strong>. Never be around a poet for too long because one ear is always on what someone else is saying because you know that there is something of interest going on there. And of course, there's always what we're looking at in and around the world as well. <strong>Trying to find ways of making the familiar unfamiliar, or defamiliarizing it</strong>, making it strange so you can actually get to a deeper or a different truth about it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You mentioned the writing things down. I think writers are similar, whatever form you write in. Obviously, I write novels and short stories, but I write phrases down and lines and quotes in my Things app, which is on my phone. But also I use journals. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where do you write down things? How do you capture those ideas?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Oh, my system is so broken in terms of how it works. Right now, the most immediate thing is I have a little <strong>list app on my phone</strong> and that tends to be the first place where things get scribbled down. If I think that something longer is emerging in the moment, I will move it to the <strong>Notes app on the phone</strong>, and that will have a lot of stuttering first drafts on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <strong>work-in-progress notebook</strong> that always comes around with me and is currently in my jacket pocket. And then for stuff that I know, if I'm not going to do anything with right now, I have a <strong>bright orange notebook, sort of Moleskine type thing,</strong> which sits somewhere. That's my Spark book type thing where all those sorts of errant phrases that don't have a home yet, or ideas just sort of get parked. So that's there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I've got a <strong>drawer in my desk where fragments that could coalesce into bigger ideas, and sketches of poems or sketches of other projects</strong>, they tend to get shoved in there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there's some <strong>weird sort of triage system</strong> that happens as ideas gather along with each other and things will get pulled out the drawer and put to the one side of the desk and <strong>gradually out of all that something bigger starts to cohere together</strong>. I frankly have horrified myself just trying to describe that there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You probably find this too, I'll write all this stuff down. And then so often, what I'm actually working on has no relationship to the stuff I might have written down. And then I might discover, years later, like I discovered the idea for my first novel, which I thought I'd had that idea in 2009. I found it in a journal from around 2003. So <strong>I'd had the idea before, I'd forgotten the idea, and then it had come back in my subconscious somehow</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can we trust that the important things will come back even if we think we've lost them?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I think so. I think it's also a case of trusting that they will come back when the time is right for them to come back and that <strong>you as a writer have sufficient by way of skill, ability, stamina, desire to actually get that idea out there</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm always more worried if it feels like I'm not coming up with ideas. That's when it's like, &#8216;Oh, has the well run dry?' You go through periods like that where nothing is necessarily firing your interest or whatever. But gradually, it does cycle back round. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially for a poet, <strong>planning for a poet is almost an anathema</strong>. I really don't know what the books look like until there's a certain sense that you've nearly got everything that you need. And it can start to <strong>cohere into a bundle that looks like 60, 70 pages that starts to talk, where the poems start to talk to each other</strong>. That's not a rational process at all. That is very much a <strong>subconscious emotional process</strong> more than anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You did just mention about a bit of a worry if you aren't coming up with ideas, and as we speak, we're still in a pandemic, and a lot of people have struggled. I've struggled because I get a lot of ideas from my travels, all my books are about my travels. My well ran quite dry. That was the first time I'd been worried about it really in the last decade. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you deal with those dry periods? How do you kickstart things? Do you actively go looking for stuff?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I think it's slightly a delicate balance of actually is their emotional energy and bandwidth. So a lot of the over the last 18 months, 2 years, it hasn't felt as fertile or productive a time, in part because it's been so busy at my day job. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's not felt that there has been much space for things to leak in, like moving around, <strong>going to different cities is a lot of where my inspiration and observations comes from</strong>. So that has been hard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is always reading to be done. There is always learning from other writers to be done. And so even knowing that, okay, I might not be writing as much right now. But it's a chance to actually catch up on so many great books that have been published over how many years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The more that you read, the more that you will get fired up again</strong> because you're seeing what other people are doing, how they're experimenting, how they're addressing different subject matter. And, again, the process is not direct, but someone will do something and you've launched that away and go, &#8216;Okay, that's an interesting way of attacking that subject' or, &#8216;Okay, that's an interesting way of tweaking that form. I haven't thought of that.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when it's not necessarily coming from you, you know that <strong>reading as your superpower means that you can always get something that will benefit you later on</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. And then, this might be a difficult question, but when do you know when a poem is finished? Because I feel like the tinkering of language is something that poets enjoy so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you know, yes, this poem is finished?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: The cliché being that a <strong>poem is never finished, it's only ever abandoned</strong>. It's different for every poet. I can characterize it no better than you have to have your spidey sense working. And it sounds mystical nonsense to say it, but <strong>the poem will generally tell you when it is finished</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best that I can characterize it as is that <strong>every poem has a certain type of energy</strong>. And what you're trying to do through the drafting process is maintain that energy, and <strong>make sure that the poem achieves what it wants to achieve within the space that you've given it</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is very definitely <strong>a point you will over-tinker,</strong> where you can take out one word too many, add one word too many change a piece of syntax or punctuation, and that energy starts to leak away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's what I'm always looking for. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does it now feel enough on the page to me, or does it still have a liveliness and the spring to it that makes me still want to read it? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And the frustrating thing is, you can't really formulize that. Sometimes it will take 17 drafts to get there. Sometimes you can be done in four, five. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just have to be alive and alert to that. And of course, that's just your judgment. I'm very fortunate to work with a brilliant editor, Jane Commane at Nine Arches Press. You end up relying a lot on that judgment as well because they're coming to it cold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They're not going to be as close to it as you are and so they will be able to see things which are screamingly obvious in terms of that need to be changed that are wrong as well. So the process is never just wholly reliant on you, but it's sort of 90% reliant on you. You have to develop that sense of judgment that the thing is done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: You mentioned a bit ago about the 60, 70 pages, which is when you have a collection, I guess, and poems start to talk to each other somehow. I got your poetry collection <em>Ticker-tape</em> and was having a look at that. And obviously, you play with these different forms on the page, I got it as an ebook. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an ebook, <strong>we can't control the look of the page as much as you can in a physical form</strong>. So what's your process of publication, because a lot of people listening are both independent authors, but also have traditional contracts and things like that. And we all do different formats. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does your traditional publishing process work?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I've reached the stage in my relationship with Jane where I trust her implicitly in terms of the feedback and the steer that she gives me. So I will always listen to her. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, I will have a <strong>loose idea in my head in terms of a theme, and arc, an idea that a book might want to carry</strong>. And then it's a process of roughly pulling things together that might speak to that. I do that in quite a quick flurry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I email that very rough first manuscript to Jane very hastily, and just basically saying, &#8216;Take it off my hands, I don't want to see it again.' And because <strong>the lead times in poetry are so long and slow,</strong> there's a lot of time for things to basically sit and mature, and wait. So if I give you an indication, we're working on my third book at the moment, and that's not due to come out until 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: We've got a lot of time just to actually <strong>play about with stuff, take poems out, reorder stuff, rewrite.</strong> But we agreed that we're not going to touch it for a year. So the manuscript is just sitting and waiting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we do come to it next year, we're going to attack it with a fresh vigor and come to it cold. That's an indication of just one editorial relationship. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The good thing about poetry, of course, is that, especially now, the means of getting out there, and getting your work out there, and getting to market, are so much more wide and wildly varied than they ever have been. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I work in a relatively traditional manner, directly with an independent publisher based up in Coventry. It's a non-agented relationship, so I was fortunate that I sent Jane some poems and she liked them so much, she wanted to publish the book, which became <em>Ticker-tape</em>, and we've developed the relationship from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of other people that work in different ways that go to the web as their port of call. Of course, self-publishing, maybe using social media as another means, using YouTube as another means of getting work out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How you publish and how you get to market is really ultimately dependent on what it is that you want to achieve,</strong> and what you feel the best form for your poems are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of poets writing, for whom actually a book is not even close to being the end goal because <strong>the poem is the poem and actually standing up performing it, it hitting the air,</strong> <strong>that's the important thing</strong>, and the book is an afterthought. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are poets like me who, because we've come up through what's called <strong>the page tradition, the book is the object has always been the ultimate goal.</strong> We work towards that end instead. So it is sort of dependent on you as a poet to have an idea of what it is that you might want to do, and where you might want to take your work as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Before we started recording, you said about that you do spoken word, and you do go and perform in order to sell books, which I thought was really interesting. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us about the performance side of being a poet.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Especially in British poetry, there's always been this divide between people who've come up through what's called the <strong>page traditions,</strong> or people who've published in magazines, probably, studied creative writing, or English, or something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And people who've come up through what's known as performance of the spoken word, and there's a historic overlay of race and class in that divide</strong> as well, which is probably far too complex to get into right now. Broadly speaking, and this goes back to the poet's route is the traveling troubadour, going round, bringing lyric and song to village as you go around in the middle ages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, even if you're a poet who is much more literary in approach, and bent, and wants to be known for the books, <strong>the number of books that you sell is so much smaller than compared to almost any other type of literature</strong> that is published, that you just cannot rely on publishing a book and it being in bookshops. And that's it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You have to go out and meet people. And you have to go out and read the work. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to go and organize readings, visit book shops, visit poetry nights, basically say yes to whoever will have you. So <strong>you have to learn some skills and some aspects of performance. </strong>Even if you don't call yourself a performance poet, you have to learn those things of being able to project, being able to hold a room, being able to very crudely know how to use a microphone without breaking people's eardrums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a level at which you have to have <strong>some degree of stagecraft, some degree of I know how to construct a setlist</strong>, I know how to take people from A to B, in a given moment, I know how to make 10 minutes of time work, even if you don't think of yourself as someone who is comfortable or natural on stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've certainly found that out of everything, that's been the aspect of craft that I've had to learn the most over the last couple of years, because I'm acutely aware as well that people are coming to our poetry night out of a welter of other entertainment options that they could be doing that night. They could be in watching &#8216;MasterChef' or watching the football or something on Netflix. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that people have chosen to spend time with poets and poetry, <strong>there's an element to which you have to give them a degree of show. </strong>But that doesn't mean that it has to be insubstantial. It can still be deep and serious, but there is that respect that you have to give the audience by turning up and giving your work the respect it deserves as well when it hits the air. So not mumbling, not keeping your eyes down on stage, that sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: Have you learned that through practice and doing things, or have you done courses and things on performance?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: It's mostly through learning as doing it, and sinking, or swimming, whatever it might be. I've done a couple of courses to work on stuff like my breath, and just to feel more comfortable projecting and being able to take control of a stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm also fortunate that as part of <a href=\"https://malikaspoetrykitchen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Malika's Kitchen</a>, that collective, Malika Booker, the founder, Roger Robinson, the other founder, they're two of our great poets, but they're two great performers as well. I've worked with Roger and Malika in the past to actually build up my confidence in terms of how to take hold of the stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a reading that I did maybe getting on for about seven, eight years ago. Malika and Roger were directing that, it was like the soundtrack. That was basically a 2-hour masterclass for me in terms of how to take them and take them on the first stage for a 300 seat audience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the things that Roger told me that day, I still use it when I'm preparing a performance just in terms of keying and <strong>what I need to key into emotionally to be able to then transfer that to the audience. How I need to hold someone's eye in the audience, how I need to find someone to direct the performance to</strong> for the evening, whether it's five minutes, whether it's half an hour, all those things you have to have at least a consideration of. It's definitely something that I've mostly learned on the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had <strong>horror shows. I've had gigs where one person has turned up</strong> and, oh, my goodness, that's a tough night for all of us concerned. I've done my time standing on tables in pubs when the football's been on and tried to get attention that way. <strong>Everyone has to go through that sort of apprenticeship, without fail, and you have to tune into the absurdity of it </strong>and run with it or you don't, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I've always remembered you as someone with good humor, and an ability to laugh. And my memories of you are laughing. It might have been because we were in the bar so often!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yeah, sounds true.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>As serious as poetry is, and as much as it changes lives, and as much as it is an investigation of language doing different things under pressure, there is an inherently absurd aspect to it as well. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course there is, I think, and you have to lean into that a bit. Because very few of us are going to be geniuses at the level of Penny or Hughes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the rest of us who are toiling in their shadows, you might as well enjoy it. Otherwise, why are you doing it? That's not to detract from the seriousness of the work, or the seriousness of what you are saying. But I think as much as <strong>you want to move the audience, you want to also leave them with their hearts a little lighter</strong> as well. I think laughter is a useful tool in your armory to be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. Especially laughing at yourself when things are difficult, which I think we all need to do. You mentioned that obviously performing in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How can poets and other writers embrace the audio and video opportunities available now online? Especially with the pandemic. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you been doing a lot more online stuff in terms of multimedia?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yes. Come March 2020, it was very acute in terms of just the juddering way in which everything moved online. I felt that very much because <strong>my second book was due to come out of the week that we went into lockdown.</strong> So my launch party, all the gigs that I had lined up for that first couple of weeks, all canceled. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If producers were agile enough, some shifted online, but <strong>we were very much feeling our way, and that spirit of experimentation carried through</strong>. So I did things like, on the night of publication, I did a 20-minute set on Twitter via a periscope, just literally holding my phone up and just barking down that to the 50 of people who wanted to just spend Thursday night being shouted out by man in the crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last 18 months has seen iterations of doing that sort of thing. I think you've seen that people very rapidly have found ways of working that worked for them. It's been very <strong>beneficial in terms of accessibility </strong>for people, both in terms of the fact that <strong>you can now provide captions</strong>, and the fact that you can get audiences but also <strong>perform for audiences in a much bigger locale</strong> than you ever could before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've done gigs for American audiences which would have been a lot harder even three years ago, just in terms of not having to travel and so you're suddenly opened up to a different thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performing down the line does bring its own set of challenges. I think <strong>the energy that you need to actually convey the personality that you might want to project down a Zoom call is actually a lot greater than you might anticipate</strong> than if you were in the room. I find online readings actually more draining than offline readings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning how to make the most of the tech on the platform has been hard. Some people are better at it than others, even things like do you actually invest in ring lights? Can you actually make sure that your laptop is set up in the right height so that your eye line is level, as opposed to looking up or looking down? Things like that people have had to learn on the go, and people are getting better at it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The best thing that you can do is, as ever, say yes to stuff, and then work out how to do it as you go along. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And not being scared of this stuff. And just go, ultimately, what's the worst that happens? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You read some poems into a Zoom call, some people send some emoticons and emojis in the chat and then on you go. It's not as scary as it first feels, I think is the main thing. Try and to embrace it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that's great. I do agree with you that I think people didn't realize how much energy you do expend it through a screen because you're still trying to project, in fact, you have to project energy through the screen in the same way that you would in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of people understand that now because people are like, &#8216;Oh, I just can't do Zoom calls all day, it's so tiring.' I feel like &#8216;normal people' in quotation marks now understand this as well as we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yes, absolutely. There's something about most performances happening in different space. So <strong>you're going somewhere, you have that time to prepare, you have that time to get to that headspace</strong>, as opposed to say, in my case, I'm working from my study. And then I maybe have five minutes. I have to try and get into the performance headspace. It's a weird sort of decompression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could do things, again, I think I would be a lot stricter with, okay, if I am performing tonight online, I need to treat it as I would have done a physical gig and so <strong>stopped work earlier</strong> so I have time to decompress from that. I can then build the energy up to do the performance again, as opposed to at 7:00 need to log off the work, email, and jump onto the Zoom call. These are things that we've only discovered as we've had to do them, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, it leads to much more by way of performance opportunities and differing modes of doing things as well. I really do hope that more producers will make <strong>more events hybrid</strong>. I'd love to be able to do <strong>more live in-person readings, but with people dialing in from all different parts of the world</strong> so you actually have this lovely mix of people and voices in the room but elsewhere around the world. That seems like one of the things that we should take away from the last two years that you can expand the possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. You talked about the poetry collection, Malika's Poetry Kitchen. I love this idea of The Writers Collective, which I feel is not so common in perhaps the longer form book space. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us about Malika's Poetry Kitchen and how you work together in a collective.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Malika started Kitchen&#8230;oh, we're celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Collective actually. So that's when the book came out. We've been doing lots of events in the weekend over the last couple of months to celebrate that fact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Malika started writing back in 2000, 2001, one of the things she quickly felt was that <strong>there was a definite lack of support for writers like her who were just starting, but also in particular writers of color</strong> who were just starting as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poetry establishment at the time was very sniffy, very snobby, and had effectively placed poets of color in that box, which is, &#8216;Okay, you are just stand up performers, you're spoken word people, you don't have a sense of craft on the page. We're not particularly that interested in helping you advance what you're writing and how you're writing.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchen started from Malika and Roger wanting to change that, and in a very DIY way, saying, &#8216;Okay, we're going to set up something that means that we can help ourselves.' It started in Malika's house in Brixton. Malika and Roger invited a couple of other poets over who are looking for a similar thing. And it's grown from there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, each week, one of them would organize some sort of workshop exercise where they'd read, they'd work through different poems, they'd bring crafts, they'd workshop those. <strong>From those small roots, it's just grown, and grown, and grown, to the point at which poets from around the world come and give masterclasses</strong> to people in the group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many brilliant poets, who we read now who are <strong>winning awards and prizes</strong> have come through and been members of The Collective at the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's always been a free-floating thing. So you come and you're a member for a bit, and then you move on, or you're sort of a more long-standing member like I might be, eight, nine years or so now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing has always been mutual support. And the idea that we all learn from each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crucially, we're not trying to impose our tastes on each other, or all trying to write in a similar voice. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the book, and when you read the book, you'll see that of the 70 odd poems in that, not one sounds like the other, which is just a testament to the fact that what we're there to do when we round the table, is make everyone's work better, and <strong>help them achieve what they're trying to achieve in the work.</strong> But we're not trying to impose our own aesthetic standards on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through it, people have developed their skills in leading workshops, developing their performance skills, just developing their confidence and their ability to inhabit the position that says, &#8216;I am a writer, I'm a poet,' which is often quite a scary thing for people to actually take on as well. I think there is a part, yeah, and I think why is it that there's more sort of poetry help in that form. I think there is a practical thing here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In two hours, we can get through a lot of work, we can get through a lot of people's poems as opposed to looking at longer pieces over a longer term. I think we have more agility and fluidity when thinking about that, as opposed to thinking about big chunks of pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. You mentioned what the poetry establishment was like back in the early 2000s. Do you think things have changed now? In one way, we see some things changing in some ways. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you feel that the poetry establishment has changed and is more open now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Yes, it has. If I give you an example of how dire things were, the Arts Council commissioned Bernadine Evaristo in fact to write a report on the state of British poetry back in 2005. What she found was that only 1% of the collections published in the previous year had been written by writers of color, which was, in terms of representation was just stunning, a stunning fact, just one word, just gobsmacking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since that point, there has been a lot of money and effort put into bringing forward and bringing through writers of color. I've been a beneficiary of some of those schemes, so the cards on the table there. I think there has been over the last 15 years in particular, an acceptance that <strong>if your conception of what passes for poetry in Britain, is one that is very white, middle class, university-educated, you're missing out on the wide richness of what is going on</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the point at which now we're seeing <strong>writers of color winning awards, getting their dues in terms of wider coverage</strong> as well. Roger Robinson winning the T. S. Eliot, a couple of years ago, Malika won the Ford prize for best single poem a couple of years ago, Kayo Chingonyi, being nominated for Forward and T. S. Eliot prizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should stress these aren't just mere tokenistic representations. These are <strong>brilliant pieces of work coming through that are finding their readers</strong>, winning the plaudits, because they are so good. But there is <strong>15 to 20 years of graft that underlies that success, and opening doors, battering down doors</strong> when they won't be opened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say to people now that if you are writing a history of British poetry, you can't tell it credibly now without telling that story of how Black and Asian writers have contributed massively to it over the last 20, 25 years. I'm positive that there has been change. There's always plenty more to be done, but I feel like the trend is going in the right direction, certainly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: That is great and good to hear. And that poetry collection is <em>Too Young, Too Loud, Too Different</em> for people that are interested. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us where people can find you and everything you do online.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: I mostly live on social media. Twitter is normally the best place to find me because that is where I hang out. And that is where I share most of my stuff. I'm @betarish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write occasionally for &#8216;The Guardian.' So you'll sometimes find me there. A route of doing poetry reviews, I do stuff for &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Rialto' magazine</a>. On occasion, Rialto is one of our best poetry magazines in the UK. So that's always worth a dive in when it comes out, which is three times a year. I'm sometimes lurking on Instagram, but that's mostly cat pictures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna: Tell us the names of your books so that people who buy your books can get them.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Oh, well, that's very kind, the invitation to flaunt myself. But yes, as you mentioned, <em>Ticker-tape</em> was my debut and that came out in 2017. And then my second book <em>Saffron Jack</em> came out in March 2020. And they're both published by Nine Arches Press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant. Well, thanks so much for your time, Rishi. That was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rishi: Not at all.

His latest book is <em>Everyone Has What it Takes: A Writer's Guide to the End of Self-Doubt</em>. Welcome to the show, Bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Thank you, Joanna. It's good to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's great to have you on the show. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a little bit more about you and how you got into writing and publishing.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Writing, I got into very young. I knew <strong>the arts were really the only path I was interested in</strong>. And though I dabbled in theater pretty seriously in my early to mid-20s and I went to Hollywood briefly with the idea of being a screenwriter. Prose was really where I was most comfortable and writing and prose was where I was most comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that was really always the plan for me. I knew people did want to be things besides artists, but it was hard for me to understand why. It just seemed like the best possible way to earn a living if you could do that. I was singularly set on that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as publishing though, when I thought about being a writer, <strong>publishing was simply what other people did</strong>; it was like a giant oven run by agents and editors, into which I inserted a manuscript and out popped mysteriously, a fully baked book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn't see myself as getting into publishing. Although interestingly, Joanna&#8230; Actually, I was thinking about this beforehand in a way because I know this podcast, a lot of your listeners are indie published. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theater I did when I was in my early 20s, my brother and I put on a sketch comedy show and it came about because I was doing poetry readings that were very theatrical, and my brother and I said, &#8216;Let's do a show.' And part of the reason we did it was I was writing stories and poems and sending them off to magazines and was not enjoying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I just didn't like the rejection, but also, <strong>I was frustrated with the gatekeeper set up</strong>, what I thought of as the gatekeeper. I thought, &#8216;Well, <strong>why does this one person determine who gets to read my stuff?</strong>&#8216; It seemed weird. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I found myself standing on a stage because it was sort of like I was going to just art spaces and areas where anybody could just get up and do stuff, sort of like open mic type situations. I thought, &#8216;Well, why not just find some place where I put the thing up and anybody who wants come can come and they can decide if they like it or not.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was essentially self-publishing theater. I wrote it, my brother and I directed it. We found the venue, we put up the posters and people started coming. So it was independent. It made sense to me at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I would also argue you're a podcaster and this is publication. We create a product with our voices. We hit publish and no one else gets in the way, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How long have you been podcasting now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I've been podcasting for 10 years. And even before that, this is what I was going to say, is I was writing and submitting. And remember when I started writing fiction, this was in the early '90s. Self-publishing was such a hard sell because it didn't have the digital world, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And there was a big stigma back then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: And it was a stigma around it. I just had zero interest in it. So I was wanting to publish traditionally and not having much luck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started &#8216;Author Magazine,' I was publishing an essay every day. I would write one a day. But <strong>I was the editor-in-chief. I was the gatekeeper</strong>. So I was essentially self&#8230;not essentially. I was self-publishing. It's just that I had an established audience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was really where I found my voice. One of the challenges that people have around publishing, and it's a pretty&#8230; It's not even disguised, the idea of getting published traditionally, which I am now. That's what I do, latest last few books were. But there's a wanting of <strong>validation. That's a big reason people go towards the publishers</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want that validation and they feel that they'll get it. They'll feel that validation in themselves when a New York publisher says, &#8216;Yeah. We'll take your book.' I don't think you can get that from other people until you give it to yourself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I published those essays without any gatekeeper, without even barely a proofreader, frankly, I didn't finally find someone who would proofread them because I was putting them out so fast. I was saying to myself, &#8216;I don't need to look to anybody.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That really taught me how to work with traditional publishers to find the correct emotional set point to work with people in the traditional publishing world that I really got from being essentially self-published. Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. You mentioned validation there and, of course, this book. You've got a number of books, but this one is about the end of self-doubt and I feel what's so interesting in the traditional industry is <strong>there's a lot of rejection, as you mentioned, which amplifies self-doubt even further.</strong> So let's get into it. What are the different aspects of when you might feel that way?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the different ways that authors might experience self-doubt? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I think it's basically <strong>writing is like a task designed to confront your own feelings of self-doubt</strong> because you sit down and you face a blank page and really all you know is that you're interested in the story. That's all you know about the story, that you are interested. You don't know who else is going to be interested in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to trust the fact that your interest in it is enough to, A, that that story is worthy of your attention and that if you're interested, someone else might be interested, but it's not known. <strong>That is a level of faith that you need because all you have is what's inside you.</strong> So that's where it starts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that you're interested has to be enough. When I'm giving these talks, it's like, that's all Shakespeare got. That's all Emily Dickinson, or Toni Morrison, or Stephen King, or Joanna Penn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's all you get. Eventually, people start saying, &#8216;Oh, I really liked your stuff.' That's nice, but it doesn't start there. Even if you get praise as a young person, is that step to professionalism? Does the praise you get from your teachers or parents or whoever, does it translate? Will it translate? And it's very easy to question whether it would. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it begins right away. It happens every time you reach the end of a sentence and you're not sure what comes next. This is a common experience. You're riding along, it's going great, and then you're not sure what comes next. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is the moment where you also have to deal with self-doubt because <strong>you have to trust that the next idea will come, the next sentence will come</strong>. And if you begin to doubt that it will come, it won't. Period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you are holding doubt that the next idea will come, it's like you're holding the door to where ideas come from closed. So <strong>you have to be in a constant trusting state to allow the ideas to come.</strong> Because if you knew the whole thing, you wouldn't write it. You're writing to discover. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, of course, rejection. I'm the editor of &#8216;Author Magazine' so people send me ideas for articles. And I say no to some of them, to a lot of them. Sometimes it's because they're just not the kind of thing I want to publish. Sometimes it's too similar to something I have published recently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of times it's because the person writing the essay doesn't really have a grasp on what makes a strong essay of this kind, particularly for what I'm looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I have to say no. Sometimes I try to guide them, but it doesn't really mean anything about them, but <strong>it's very easy to assume when someone doesn't want your work, that they don't want you, that no one would want your work, that your work has no value</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I liken it to relationships. I'm married. I have been married for a long time, but I used to date a lot when I was a young fellow and I came to realize that when people break up, I really came to see it as the person who ended it, if it was one person, simply was the first one to recognize the relationship wasn't working. I do not believe the relationship could be great and one person wants out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think they just simply saw, this isn't working. And so they ended it. I think that publishing is like that. You're not looking for someone to validate you just the same way you wouldn't look for a boyfriend, or girlfriend, or husband, or wife so you can feel good about yourself. You want a companion, you want a friend, and a publishing experience is a relationship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case, <strong>if you're traditionally published, you need to find someone who's into what you're into, who gets it, who is as excited as you ar</strong>e. And that's a relationship. And that requires, Joanna, you to validate yourself, the value of what you're offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that finding someone who's into what you're into, it's the same as an independent author, but we're looking for readers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Yeah. It's the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: <strong>As an indie, you have to find readers who were into what you're into</strong>. But it's interesting around self-doubt because what you've been talking about there is almost within the writing process. And, in fact, I have on my wall here, a little sign that says <strong>&#8220;trust emergence,&#8221; as in, something's going to emerge eventually if I just keep going through the page</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there's also, I've written like 30-plus books now, and I'm going to write in a new genre and <strong>I feel massive self-doubt about writing a new genre because I feel like I'm starting all over again</strong>, I'm putting myself out there in a different way. I feel vulnerable about it. It's going to have memoir in. So this is a lot of personal stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can there ever really be an end to self-doubt?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I think what it's like is in my last book, <em>Fearless Writing</em>, I talked about mastery and I defined it this way. I tell this story, it's a pretty famous story in the martial arts community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took Aikido and there's the guy who founded Aikido was named Morihei Ueshiba, but they called him Ōsensei, meaning first teacher. Aikido is a defensive martial art and the whole key to it is staying balanced. If you're in balance, then it's very hard to knock you over and it's very easy to throw someone who's attacking you because attacks always put people off balance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whole point, <strong>you stay on balance, stay on balance, stay on balance</strong>. That's the whole practice. There's a story of where one of Ōsensei's longtime students is watching him and he just can't believe how grounded and balanced Ōsensei is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until finally the student comes up to him and says, &#8216;Ōsensei, I train every day. And every time I train, I am off balance and then I watch you and you are never off-balance. How do you do it?' Ōsensei says, &#8216;Oh, no, no, no. <strong>I am frequently off-balanced. I am just very fast to get back on balance</strong>.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you're wanting is the difference. It's never going to happen that the thought won't come into your head. What if I can't do this, right? You can't inoculate yourself against it, but you don't have to spend days swimming around and wondering about the future. You can, with practice say, &#8216;I don't know what's going to happen, but I do know I'm interested. Is that enough? Can I be okay with that being enough? Not understanding what will happen with this book.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That happens to me every time I write. <strong>I don't know really what's going to happen with this book. I don't know where it's going. I don't know who's going to buy it</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I interviewed Alice Hoffman who sold like what? Thirty books. I don't think she's ever been rejected. She's had her movies made. She's won rewards. And I was talking to her and she was like, &#8216;Every time I write a book, I think, I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to write a book.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time she starts a new one and every time she's in the middle, she thinks, &#8216;This is just not going to work. I won't get it and no one will like it.' And then she finishes it. So she's going through that process again and again. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The question is how much time will you spend in self-doubt? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What I've realized is I've gotten faster and faster at letting that thought go, realizing there's no way to answer it. There's no way to answer that question, what will happen? You don't know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You've got to focus on what you do know and what you always know is, &#8216;I'm interested.' But can I be more interested in how I translate this new idea than in who will like it?' That's down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'll figure that out once I'm actually finished with it because, by the way, Joanna, until you finish the book, you don't really know how to sell it, for instance. You've got to finish it. You got to know what the heck you've got. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though if you have a concept of it, <strong>I don't think until you've reached the end, you really understand what you're trying to write</strong>. And then you could have a sense of how you sell it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It's never going to go away, but you don't have to wallow in it. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don't have to indulge the thought. You don't have to answer the question, &#8216;What if no one likes it?' You can't answer it for one thing and you don't even have to address it. Everyone has what it takes really is an attempt to address the question, what if I don't have what it takes? And it's an unanswerable question. The question you shouldn't ever ask it, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think also <strong>sometimes self-doubt is justified</strong>. For example, when you write in your first novel, there's a lot you need to learn. Or, in fact, even when you're writing your 10th novel, there's always something to learn. I think we need to recognize what category the self-doubt goes into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I would just want to get rid of the word doubt. It's semantics, but I will push back just a bit in that doubt is wondering&#8230; It is perfectly legitimate to say, &#8216;I don't know how to do this. I have to learn. And I want to learn if I even want to do it.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Am I interested enough to put the work in to figure it out?</strong> Because writing a novel is a whole thing. Writing a book is the whole thing. You don't know how to do it. You've got to learn and you also got to learn if you want to do it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you've got to do it for six months to go like, &#8216;This is just not my thing. I'm not interested. I want to do something else.' Like a relationship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is legitimate to say I don't know, but you don't have to doubt yourself. You've got to pay attention to what you do know, which is I'm interested, and that has to be enough to see how far can I go with this? Because the doubt is just saying, &#8216;Well, what if I don't?' But there's no way to answer that. There's no way to answer, &#8216;What if I can't? What if I don't?' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until you get there and then you'll know if you care, because I will say, because if you had told me&#8230; I didn't publish my first book, really. And I started writing novels, books when I was 25 and I didn't really publish till I was what? 50. Really. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you had told me, &#8216;Okay, get ready. 20, 25 years,' I would've said, &#8216;Just kill me now.' I cannot do that. I will never be happy for that time. That is unlivable. But I was wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I said, &#8216;What if I don't publish them?' I wouldn't have known how to answer. And I'd learned how to live and not publish them. I had to do it by experience. Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. I also do want to come back on the other bit of the title, is <em>Everyone Has What It Takes</em>. And again, this comes back to your relationship thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've been doing this really since 2006, I started writing properly. And so many people have left the industry. So many writers, some people really do only have one book in them or they just decide, &#8216;I'm done.'</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does everyone really have what it takes? When is it okay to quit?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I was teaching this class on &#8216;Everyone Has What It Takes.' And if I could have written the whole title, it would have been, &#8216;Everyone Has What It Takes To Succeed At The Thing They Love To Do.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Everyone has what it takes to do the thing they love to do. It may not be writing. </strong>No, everyone does not have what it takes to be a writer because not everyone wants to write. Not everyone wants to sit alone in front of a blank page. There's a lot of people who need the thing they do to involve other people and writing may eventually, but a lot of that time is spent without other people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has what it takes to and if it's just write one book, well, then that's fine too. Like <strong>there's no one career that is correct. You don't have to write</strong>. It's not fair to say that if you write three books a year, those books must be crap, or what's wrong with you? You're only producing one book every five years, you must be lazy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or what was wrong with the woman who wrote <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>? But she only wrote one. What's up with JD Salinger? He quit publishing. There's no one way to do it. I know people are all perfectly equipped to do the thing they absolutely want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, that sketch comedy show started because of poetry. And I ran out of poetry. I just stopped. When I tuned my dial to the poetry, they stopped coming. But suddenly, I was performing the poems and those became theater, became sketch comedy. It just evolved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw the sketch comedy. I know it's weird as an evolution of poetry readings in its own way. And so maybe it'll change. <strong>I thought I was a novelist. I was sure I was a novelist. </strong>That was it. If you had told me what I was going to write, I would have said, &#8216;You are thinking of somebody else. I don't even walk into that part of the bookstore. I want nothing to do with that kind of stuff.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that's what I do. <strong>I had to evolve and learn what it is I actually want to do</strong>. So I think everybody has what it takes to do the thing they love to do. Their job is to find what that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poetry became theater because I was the performance side of it, I was really interested in and the novels became creative non-fiction. I knew I wanted to write when I was 25, but I didn't really know what it was and I just chose fiction because that's what I first was drawn to as a reader even though when I started writing fiction, I had stopped reading fiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was really tuned in, I would have noticed like, &#8216;That's not where you are you're at anymore,' but I still stuck with it for 20 years. It was hard journey for me to come to finding what it is I really love to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I say, when everyone has what it takes, you can't sit around wondering if you have what it takes. You'll never be able to answer that. <strong>The only question you can answer is, &#8216;What is so interesting to me?' and that you have the answer to</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And that changes over time. I think what you've said is really important. I always say to people, it's more like skiing. It's like a zigzag down the slope of life like you did. You're like, &#8216;Okay. I like poetry.' And then it's like, &#8216;Hmm, not quite.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm the same. I did poetry in my younger years and got published as a poet and then it disappeared. It wasn't the thing. And then I went in another direction and now I'm about to start writing in another genre. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that what you've seen? You've interviewed so many writers as part of your &#8216;Author2Author' podcast. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Have you seen this zigzag across people's careers in general?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Sure. Some really they find their thing and they do it. It's like science fiction, science fiction, science fiction, and that's it. Or romance, romance, romance, but other people zigzag, yeah. Absolutely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always say <strong>your job isn't to get out of your comfort zone. It's to keep up with your comfort zone.</strong> I think it's always moving. I think you're always evolving and my job is to keep up with myself. My work is similar, but it's changing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work I do now, it's very similar because it's about creativity and spirituality, but it's growing and it's evolving. I see it in the other writers I've interviewed, how it's grown and changed. Sometimes changed dramatically and sometimes just change subtly because they've really found the thing they love to do. But absolutely. Absolutely, it changes. Sometimes subtly and sometimes absolutely dramatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just interviewed one of my friends, David Laskin. He had been a journalist for a while. He had written a bunch of journalistic narratives, and some of have been bestsellers, and he'd done really well, but he made a huge switch and wrote his first novel at 65 or whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had tried to do it as a memoir and had gotten rejected. He got rejected for the first time in his long writing life. And he was very distraught, but he turned it into a novel and it's doing great. That happened in his 60s. There was a huge departure, but he did it and it was fantastic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, of course. People change it. You've got to follow yourself. You've got to be able to ask yourself, &#8216;<strong>What do I want now? What's interesting to me now? I know this was interesting yesterday, but is it still interesting in the same way?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You're like a tree that keeps growing. I was thinking the tree is such a great analogy. I've got one in my backyard, this apple tree. It's complete, but it keeps growing. It's a total tree. <strong>There's nothing missing from it and yet it keeps changing</strong>. And I think we're like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Again, just coming back on all the authors you've interviewed: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What else have you seen in terms of commonalities of long-term success with a writing career, whether that might be practice, or business stuff?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: It's definitely: <strong>write the thing you love.</strong> That is the common thread through. I've interviewed writers, all shapes and sizes, romance, memoir, poetry, screenplays, literary fiction, whatever and it's always, they just love the thing. They just love that story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that is it. Love is the organizing principle of the universe, it's the fuel that drives creativity, it's the light that you follow through the jungle. It's everything. So that is it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What's the story you love to read, you love to tell? What excites you? What story has your unconditional attention? What are you interested in just because you're interested in it?</strong> That is absolutely the most common thing. All have that in common. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody approaches business differently. Most of them have a writing routine, but not all of them. Some of them don't.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew one woman who wrote novels and the way she wrote them is she only did the dialogue first. She just wrote complete dialogue and then she'd go back and put the prose. And I was like, &#8216;What?' But yeah, that's how she did it. So there's no one way to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I would say do try to <strong>come up with a regular time to write if you can</strong>; it's a good idea, but there are writers who say I do it on the airplane, I do it on the train. I do it wherever I can. So there's always an exception. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing that there is not an exception to, I think, is that the writer loves the story. I know that sounds pat, but you'll never be better at anything than the thing you love to do, period. If you love doing it, that's the best you'll be. So find the story you love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that's right. What's interesting is obviously we're recording this. We're still in pandemic times and you write a lot about mindset and obviously creativity. And yet, even if we love writing, a lot of people have suffered from burnout, mental health issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get my inspiration from traveling. So my well is dry, basically, which is one of the reasons I'm looking at different genres because I'm struggling with writing what I normally love. So how do we deal with this? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should we just force ourselves into it or should we really listen to what's going on and change what we do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: So the question is how do you deal with burnout? Because of the, say the circumstances we're in. Is that what you're asking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I think of conditions like a surface I stand on. So to go back to the Ōsensei metaphor, remember, he just wanted to be balanced. <strong>The conditions are like the surface.</strong> Sometimes I'm trying to walk on a balance beam and sometimes I'm standing on flat ground. I can always find my balance, but it's easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for you, your creativity, you discovered that you could be inspired by traveling. You found inspiration in that. I would posit to you, your inspiration comes from the same place everybody's does, which is inside you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually didn't come from outside of you, but the experience was one that you found easily sent you into where inspiration was. I can never attribute my complete well-being to my conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there are conditions like being in the middle of a war zone that would be like walking a tight rope for me and I fall off a tight rope, but somewhere is someone who can be at peace in a war zone. I'm not that person now, but I didn't think I was the person who could live with all that rejection and be okay. And I was. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, that was a tight rope and I fell off it, but I learned how to walk it. So I would say <strong>if you're feeling down because conditions have changed, your situation has changed, you never want to feel that your happiness is dependent on something outside your own heart</strong> because that can always go away. And so I would say look in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe this opportunity to do this work is a way of teaching you that you're even more creative than you thought, that you have a wellspring that doesn't rely on that completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There's nothing wrong with it. There are a lot of things I do which help bring out creativity in me, but I never want to mistake the activity for the creativity itself. I love to write. <strong>Writing is great. I love the experience, but still, it's not the writing. I love. It's where I go when I write</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's easiest to go there while writing, but I can go there just sitting in a chair by myself. It's not dependent on the writing. The writing just helps me get there. We're going deep here, Joanna, but I think that's what you're asking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do I need these conditions to be that way to be creative? And I say no</strong>. Let this experience be an opportunity to learn where your real creativity is, which is really always inside you. It's always coming from within you. Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It does. Although you also talked about, you have to follow your curiosity and what you love and what you're curious about. I'm basically curious about places and historical things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Here's what I would say then. Then this is what you do too. Because that's not going away, right? Obviously, that's not going away that curiosity. You can't make your curiosity go away. It doesn't go anywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you say, &#8216;Okay, so what do I do with that? I'm used to having the opportunity to literally physically go out and follow that curiosity across the globe. <strong>How does that curiosity express itself now?' Maybe there's a way to express itself that you simply haven't found.</strong> You're so used to being able to do it this other way for obvious reasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, by the way, you'll get to do it again. That'll come back, but maybe there is another way for it to express itself that you haven't discovered yet because you may not have asked the question. You may have assumed it had to go this way, that you simply never asked the question and so you didn't discover the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: In my case, I just decided to travel in my own country. So I'm writing books about my own country instead of other places. But I want to come back to what you said. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>You said, &#8216;I have a lot of things I do that bring out creativity in me.' </strong>What are those things?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Well, doing this. Honestly; <strong>conversations. I play the piano and I write music</strong>. That's a hobby of mine that might've been a profession if I were slightly different person. So that for sure. <strong>I design games, I'm a game designer, role-playing games. And the podcast is creative</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't prepare anything, but it doesn't matter. Some people prepare, some people don't, but I look upon it as just like let's see what's going to happen. I'm so interested to learn about this person. It's what we call <strong>a co-creative experience. I feed off of them, they feed off of me</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversations, workshops, clients, all these things generate creativity in me because I have to think differently about that moment. I have to think differently about the client, I have to think differently about the guest, I have to think differently about the song I'm writing, the game I'm designing. All of it is creative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really, <strong>all of life is creative</strong>. The more I have learned to see my life away from the desk as no different from my life at the desk, the more I'm able to see myself as the author of my life, not just this person dealing with it, and managing it, and reacting to it, the better I've been. <strong>The more I can see the whole life experience as creative, like my life is a blank page, the happier I am </strong>and the more I thrive and the better husband, and father, and friend, I am. I always benefit when I see life itself as a creative act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I agree with you. I think there's so much that can be creative. I guess obviously this show is very much about the business of being a writer as well as the art. And so there you talked about music, about game design. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are these creative play activities or these creative business activities?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: They've been both. I'm an award-winning game designer. We published a bunch of these things through our company, but I also do it for fun. The music is for fun, but I think I secretly wish it was a profession, but I'm shy about my voice, my singing voice, not my speaking voice, but my singing. So I haven't allowed it to become more than an extremely prolific hobby. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try to <strong>see all of my work as play as much as possible</strong>. I say everything I'm paid to do, I would happily do for free. I also like getting paid for it, but that's my framework. I know how to work. I know how to do things that I don't really want to do and get paid for it and I spent a long time doing that, and I'm not interested in that anymore. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I want to see how I can make money doing something that feels like fun. In fact, this is true. I was just doing, so recording the book yesterday at this lovely studio here in Seattle and so I go there and there's the technician in there and then we've got this director who's, I don't know, in LA or something, we're all wired together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've got my headphones on and, Will, the engineer, this really sweet guy, just as we're about to start, he's like, &#8216;Man, isn't this fun? Guys, can you believe we get to be paid to do this? Isn't this great?' And I was like, &#8216;Man, he is singing my tune. He is singing my tune.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm with you. I love all this. I love the podcast as well. And I also think it is creative. It's interesting how <strong>people seem to talk about podcasting as marketing, but I think you and I can see that it's actually a creative process</strong>. And as you say, often I change my mind in talking to people or I get ideas when I'm talking to people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your &#8216;Author2Author Magazine' and the podcast and everything, obviously book marketing is a practical part of the business. What are your thoughts on that? You are an author, you have the magazine, you have all this stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do for book marketing personally?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Actually one of my popular classes, Joanna, I teach is called &#8216;Fearless Marketing.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: What I always say when I teach the class is like I'm not going to actually teach you how to do any marketing. What I'm going to teach you to do is stop hating it because <strong>you can't do it well until you stop hating it</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think about marketing, here's the first thing I think of. I'm trying to define the conversation I'm offering. So I go to a writer's conference. I like to go to writers, conference. Well, once again, I will go to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every classroom is offering a different conversation. Some are talking about how to use social media, another one is like, how do you have a grabber opening? Mine is about the emotional challenges of writing. All the conversations are legitimate. How do you world-build all? These are good conversations for writers to have. This is the conversation I want to have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try to describe the conversation accurately in the little brochure and say, &#8216;Who wants to come?' And people want to come. Here's the conversation I'm interested in. And so that's the first thing I think it's really helpful for writers, <strong>define the conversation. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you write romance, you want to be with other romance writers who want to think about romance in that way. They want to think about love and relationships in that way. I'm interested in creativity and spirituality. That's a different conversation. You go to a party and it's like they're talking about politics over here, and soccer over there, and science-fiction over there. <strong>What conversation do you want to be a part of? </strong>That's the first thing I say.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>There are so many different ways to market yourself. Find the thing that you are most interested in. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to write essays, blogs. So I do that. And with the theory that if you like my blog, you might like my book. It's the same kind of stuff. And if you listen to my podcast, technically, Joanna, my podcast, it's my platform as you know, that word. My platform is just, I like talking to people who make stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took an agent saying, &#8216;Bill, you have a platform.' I was like, &#8216;No, I don't. I just have a bunch of things I like to do.' And she said, &#8216;That's a platform. What do you think a platform is?' I do the things I like to do. I like talking to people in these interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like doing workshops for people and I like writing essays and I post them on Twitter, and Facebook, and Instagram. Now I'm figuring that out. But I let it be an expression of the stuff that interests me. There's a lot of things you can do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew someone who marketed his book by giving readings at dive bars. That was his big idea. And it worked for him. Another one did his readings on subways. He thought that was a great idea. I'd never do that, but he'll love to do that. It sounded awful, but to him, it was an inspiration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say to your listeners, <strong>try to approach marketing with as much creativity as you can</strong>. It's great having someone like Joanna because you say, &#8216;I really want to dive into social media. That seems so cool.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are people like yourself or lots of people out there who say, &#8216;Okay. I will now teach you how to actually do it, but let's figure out what you're interested in.' There's no one right way to market a book, I don't think, in the same way, there's no right way to write a book. But you've got to find the thing that you think is cool about it and you can't hate it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can't turn your nose up at it. You can't think it's slimy. You can't think, &#8216;Nobody wants to hear from me.' You got to be as interested in, &#8216;<strong>How do I find the people who are interested in the same stuff I'm interested in?</strong> What would be the best way to describe this conversation such that people who are interested in it could recognize it as the kind of conversation they would want to have?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That to me is the friendliest way to think about marketing because that's really what it is. I'm on Twitter sometimes and people would basically saying, &#8216;Buy my book, buy my book.' And I'm like, &#8216;That can't work. What's the what's in it for me?' I've got to know what I'm being offered in this experience you want me to pay for. What's in it for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I can define a conversation, and again, probably like your fiction writers won't see it that way, but it is. It's a conversation. You start a story, the reader finishes it. Think of all you have to leave out in your stories that the reader's imagination fills in. That's a conversation. So that's how I would define it because then you know what it is you're really offering the people that they're getting from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I like that you say define the conversation because I think <strong>for non-fiction it is a title.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: It's in the title, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Your book title included the end of self-doubt and I'm like, &#8216;We should talk about that.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For fiction, I almost feel it's the promise of the genre, the title, the cover, the hook. </strong>You have to make it very clear what you're offering and then someone chooses to join that conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: That's right. I've worked a lot with writers and I find that that's one of the most common things, is they don't want to sell. They don't see themselves as salespeople. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see this odious and beneath them and it seems like they don't like being sold but they do like having conversations they want to have. They've got to see it in a friendly way. <strong>Every book's a conversation about something</strong>, about weakness and strength, about love or loss, about what's cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's always about something. From a certain angle. And so define that for yourself. As an author, you are so interested in that conversation. There's no way you can write a book and not be. And so you just got to know there's other people out there who want to have that conversation too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. Brilliant. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and your books and everything you do online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: The hub of my internet empire, Joanna, is <a href=\"https://www.williamkenower.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">williamkenower.com</a>.

I'm not a book editor, book doctor, but I do help people with their craft and also with the many, many emotional challenges writers face, like why should I do this? Am I any good?

His latest book is <em>Everyone Has What it Takes: A Writer's Guide to the End of Self-Doubt</em>. Welcome to the show, Bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Thank you, Joanna. It's good to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It's great to have you on the show. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a little bit more about you and how you got into writing and publishing.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Writing, I got into very young. I knew <strong>the arts were really the only path I was interested in</strong>. And though I dabbled in theater pretty seriously in my early to mid-20s and I went to Hollywood briefly with the idea of being a screenwriter. Prose was really where I was most comfortable and writing and prose was where I was most comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that was really always the plan for me. I knew people did want to be things besides artists, but it was hard for me to understand why. It just seemed like the best possible way to earn a living if you could do that. I was singularly set on that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as publishing though, when I thought about being a writer, <strong>publishing was simply what other people did</strong>; it was like a giant oven run by agents and editors, into which I inserted a manuscript and out popped mysteriously, a fully baked book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn't see myself as getting into publishing. Although interestingly, Joanna&#8230; Actually, I was thinking about this beforehand in a way because I know this podcast, a lot of your listeners are indie published. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theater I did when I was in my early 20s, my brother and I put on a sketch comedy show and it came about because I was doing poetry readings that were very theatrical, and my brother and I said, &#8216;Let's do a show.' And part of the reason we did it was I was writing stories and poems and sending them off to magazines and was not enjoying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I just didn't like the rejection, but also, <strong>I was frustrated with the gatekeeper set up</strong>, what I thought of as the gatekeeper. I thought, &#8216;Well, <strong>why does this one person determine who gets to read my stuff?</strong>&#8216; It seemed weird. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I found myself standing on a stage because it was sort of like I was going to just art spaces and areas where anybody could just get up and do stuff, sort of like open mic type situations. I thought, &#8216;Well, why not just find some place where I put the thing up and anybody who wants come can come and they can decide if they like it or not.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was essentially self-publishing theater. I wrote it, my brother and I directed it. We found the venue, we put up the posters and people started coming. So it was independent. It made sense to me at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I would also argue you're a podcaster and this is publication. We create a product with our voices. We hit publish and no one else gets in the way, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How long have you been podcasting now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I've been podcasting for 10 years. And even before that, this is what I was going to say, is I was writing and submitting. And remember when I started writing fiction, this was in the early '90s. Self-publishing was such a hard sell because it didn't have the digital world, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And there was a big stigma back then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: And it was a stigma around it. I just had zero interest in it. So I was wanting to publish traditionally and not having much luck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started &#8216;Author Magazine,' I was publishing an essay every day. I would write one a day. But <strong>I was the editor-in-chief. I was the gatekeeper</strong>. So I was essentially self&#8230;not essentially. I was self-publishing. It's just that I had an established audience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was really where I found my voice. One of the challenges that people have around publishing, and it's a pretty&#8230; It's not even disguised, the idea of getting published traditionally, which I am now. That's what I do, latest last few books were. But there's a wanting of <strong>validation. That's a big reason people go towards the publishers</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want that validation and they feel that they'll get it. They'll feel that validation in themselves when a New York publisher says, &#8216;Yeah. We'll take your book.' I don't think you can get that from other people until you give it to yourself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I published those essays without any gatekeeper, without even barely a proofreader, frankly, I didn't finally find someone who would proofread them because I was putting them out so fast. I was saying to myself, &#8216;I don't need to look to anybody.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That really taught me how to work with traditional publishers to find the correct emotional set point to work with people in the traditional publishing world that I really got from being essentially self-published. Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. You mentioned validation there and, of course, this book. You've got a number of books, but this one is about the end of self-doubt and I feel what's so interesting in the traditional industry is <strong>there's a lot of rejection, as you mentioned, which amplifies self-doubt even further.</strong> So let's get into it. What are the different aspects of when you might feel that way?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the different ways that authors might experience self-doubt? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I think it's basically <strong>writing is like a task designed to confront your own feelings of self-doubt</strong> because you sit down and you face a blank page and really all you know is that you're interested in the story. That's all you know about the story, that you are interested. You don't know who else is going to be interested in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to trust the fact that your interest in it is enough to, A, that that story is worthy of your attention and that if you're interested, someone else might be interested, but it's not known. <strong>That is a level of faith that you need because all you have is what's inside you.</strong> So that's where it starts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that you're interested has to be enough. When I'm giving these talks, it's like, that's all Shakespeare got. That's all Emily Dickinson, or Toni Morrison, or Stephen King, or Joanna Penn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's all you get. Eventually, people start saying, &#8216;Oh, I really liked your stuff.' That's nice, but it doesn't start there. Even if you get praise as a young person, is that step to professionalism? Does the praise you get from your teachers or parents or whoever, does it translate? Will it translate? And it's very easy to question whether it would. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it begins right away. It happens every time you reach the end of a sentence and you're not sure what comes next. This is a common experience. You're riding along, it's going great, and then you're not sure what comes next. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is the moment where you also have to deal with self-doubt because <strong>you have to trust that the next idea will come, the next sentence will come</strong>. And if you begin to doubt that it will come, it won't. Period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as you are holding doubt that the next idea will come, it's like you're holding the door to where ideas come from closed. So <strong>you have to be in a constant trusting state to allow the ideas to come.</strong> Because if you knew the whole thing, you wouldn't write it. You're writing to discover. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, of course, rejection. I'm the editor of &#8216;Author Magazine' so people send me ideas for articles. And I say no to some of them, to a lot of them. Sometimes it's because they're just not the kind of thing I want to publish. Sometimes it's too similar to something I have published recently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of times it's because the person writing the essay doesn't really have a grasp on what makes a strong essay of this kind, particularly for what I'm looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I have to say no. Sometimes I try to guide them, but it doesn't really mean anything about them, but <strong>it's very easy to assume when someone doesn't want your work, that they don't want you, that no one would want your work, that your work has no value</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I liken it to relationships. I'm married. I have been married for a long time, but I used to date a lot when I was a young fellow and I came to realize that when people break up, I really came to see it as the person who ended it, if it was one person, simply was the first one to recognize the relationship wasn't working. I do not believe the relationship could be great and one person wants out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think they just simply saw, this isn't working. And so they ended it. I think that publishing is like that. You're not looking for someone to validate you just the same way you wouldn't look for a boyfriend, or girlfriend, or husband, or wife so you can feel good about yourself. You want a companion, you want a friend, and a publishing experience is a relationship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case, <strong>if you're traditionally published, you need to find someone who's into what you're into, who gets it, who is as excited as you ar</strong>e. And that's a relationship. And that requires, Joanna, you to validate yourself, the value of what you're offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that finding someone who's into what you're into, it's the same as an independent author, but we're looking for readers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Yeah. It's the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: <strong>As an indie, you have to find readers who were into what you're into</strong>. But it's interesting around self-doubt because what you've been talking about there is almost within the writing process. And, in fact, I have on my wall here, a little sign that says <strong>&#8220;trust emergence,&#8221; as in, something's going to emerge eventually if I just keep going through the page</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there's also, I've written like 30-plus books now, and I'm going to write in a new genre and <strong>I feel massive self-doubt about writing a new genre because I feel like I'm starting all over again</strong>, I'm putting myself out there in a different way. I feel vulnerable about it. It's going to have memoir in. So this is a lot of personal stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can there ever really be an end to self-doubt?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I think what it's like is in my last book, <em>Fearless Writing</em>, I talked about mastery and I defined it this way. I tell this story, it's a pretty famous story in the martial arts community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took Aikido and there's the guy who founded Aikido was named Morihei Ueshiba, but they called him Ōsensei, meaning first teacher. Aikido is a defensive martial art and the whole key to it is staying balanced. If you're in balance, then it's very hard to knock you over and it's very easy to throw someone who's attacking you because attacks always put people off balance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whole point, <strong>you stay on balance, stay on balance, stay on balance</strong>. That's the whole practice. There's a story of where one of Ōsensei's longtime students is watching him and he just can't believe how grounded and balanced Ōsensei is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until finally the student comes up to him and says, &#8216;Ōsensei, I train every day. And every time I train, I am off balance and then I watch you and you are never off-balance. How do you do it?' Ōsensei says, &#8216;Oh, no, no, no. <strong>I am frequently off-balanced. I am just very fast to get back on balance</strong>.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you're wanting is the difference. It's never going to happen that the thought won't come into your head. What if I can't do this, right? You can't inoculate yourself against it, but you don't have to spend days swimming around and wondering about the future. You can, with practice say, &#8216;I don't know what's going to happen, but I do know I'm interested. Is that enough? Can I be okay with that being enough? Not understanding what will happen with this book.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That happens to me every time I write. <strong>I don't know really what's going to happen with this book. I don't know where it's going. I don't know who's going to buy it</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I interviewed Alice Hoffman who sold like what? Thirty books. I don't think she's ever been rejected. She's had her movies made. She's won rewards. And I was talking to her and she was like, &#8216;Every time I write a book, I think, I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to write a book.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time she starts a new one and every time she's in the middle, she thinks, &#8216;This is just not going to work. I won't get it and no one will like it.' And then she finishes it. So she's going through that process again and again. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The question is how much time will you spend in self-doubt? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What I've realized is I've gotten faster and faster at letting that thought go, realizing there's no way to answer it. There's no way to answer that question, what will happen? You don't know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You've got to focus on what you do know and what you always know is, &#8216;I'm interested.' But can I be more interested in how I translate this new idea than in who will like it?' That's down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'll figure that out once I'm actually finished with it because, by the way, Joanna, until you finish the book, you don't really know how to sell it, for instance. You've got to finish it. You got to know what the heck you've got. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though if you have a concept of it, <strong>I don't think until you've reached the end, you really understand what you're trying to write</strong>. And then you could have a sense of how you sell it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It's never going to go away, but you don't have to wallow in it. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don't have to indulge the thought. You don't have to answer the question, &#8216;What if no one likes it?' You can't answer it for one thing and you don't even have to address it. Everyone has what it takes really is an attempt to address the question, what if I don't have what it takes? And it's an unanswerable question. The question you shouldn't ever ask it, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think also <strong>sometimes self-doubt is justified</strong>. For example, when you write in your first novel, there's a lot you need to learn. Or, in fact, even when you're writing your 10th novel, there's always something to learn. I think we need to recognize what category the self-doubt goes into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I would just want to get rid of the word doubt. It's semantics, but I will push back just a bit in that doubt is wondering&#8230; It is perfectly legitimate to say, &#8216;I don't know how to do this. I have to learn. And I want to learn if I even want to do it.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Am I interested enough to put the work in to figure it out?</strong> Because writing a novel is a whole thing. Writing a book is the whole thing. You don't know how to do it. You've got to learn and you also got to learn if you want to do it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you've got to do it for six months to go like, &#8216;This is just not my thing. I'm not interested. I want to do something else.' Like a relationship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is legitimate to say I don't know, but you don't have to doubt yourself. You've got to pay attention to what you do know, which is I'm interested, and that has to be enough to see how far can I go with this? Because the doubt is just saying, &#8216;Well, what if I don't?' But there's no way to answer that. There's no way to answer, &#8216;What if I can't? What if I don't?' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until you get there and then you'll know if you care, because I will say, because if you had told me&#8230; I didn't publish my first book, really. And I started writing novels, books when I was 25 and I didn't really publish till I was what? 50. Really. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you had told me, &#8216;Okay, get ready. 20, 25 years,' I would've said, &#8216;Just kill me now.' I cannot do that. I will never be happy for that time. That is unlivable. But I was wrong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I said, &#8216;What if I don't publish them?' I wouldn't have known how to answer. And I'd learned how to live and not publish them. I had to do it by experience. Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. I also do want to come back on the other bit of the title, is <em>Everyone Has What It Takes</em>. And again, this comes back to your relationship thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've been doing this really since 2006, I started writing properly. And so many people have left the industry. So many writers, some people really do only have one book in them or they just decide, &#8216;I'm done.'</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does everyone really have what it takes? When is it okay to quit?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I was teaching this class on &#8216;Everyone Has What It Takes.' And if I could have written the whole title, it would have been, &#8216;Everyone Has What It Takes To Succeed At The Thing They Love To Do.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Everyone has what it takes to do the thing they love to do. It may not be writing. </strong>No, everyone does not have what it takes to be a writer because not everyone wants to write. Not everyone wants to sit alone in front of a blank page. There's a lot of people who need the thing they do to involve other people and writing may eventually, but a lot of that time is spent without other people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has what it takes to and if it's just write one book, well, then that's fine too. Like <strong>there's no one career that is correct. You don't have to write</strong>. It's not fair to say that if you write three books a year, those books must be crap, or what's wrong with you? You're only producing one book every five years, you must be lazy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or what was wrong with the woman who wrote <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>? But she only wrote one. What's up with JD Salinger? He quit publishing. There's no one way to do it. I know people are all perfectly equipped to do the thing they absolutely want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, that sketch comedy show started because of poetry. And I ran out of poetry. I just stopped. When I tuned my dial to the poetry, they stopped coming. But suddenly, I was performing the poems and those became theater, became sketch comedy. It just evolved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw the sketch comedy. I know it's weird as an evolution of poetry readings in its own way. And so maybe it'll change. <strong>I thought I was a novelist. I was sure I was a novelist. </strong>That was it. If you had told me what I was going to write, I would have said, &#8216;You are thinking of somebody else. I don't even walk into that part of the bookstore. I want nothing to do with that kind of stuff.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that's what I do. <strong>I had to evolve and learn what it is I actually want to do</strong>. So I think everybody has what it takes to do the thing they love to do. Their job is to find what that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The poetry became theater because I was the performance side of it, I was really interested in and the novels became creative non-fiction. I knew I wanted to write when I was 25, but I didn't really know what it was and I just chose fiction because that's what I first was drawn to as a reader even though when I started writing fiction, I had stopped reading fiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was really tuned in, I would have noticed like, &#8216;That's not where you are you're at anymore,' but I still stuck with it for 20 years. It was hard journey for me to come to finding what it is I really love to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I say, when everyone has what it takes, you can't sit around wondering if you have what it takes. You'll never be able to answer that. <strong>The only question you can answer is, &#8216;What is so interesting to me?' and that you have the answer to</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: And that changes over time. I think what you've said is really important. I always say to people, it's more like skiing. It's like a zigzag down the slope of life like you did. You're like, &#8216;Okay. I like poetry.' And then it's like, &#8216;Hmm, not quite.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm the same. I did poetry in my younger years and got published as a poet and then it disappeared. It wasn't the thing. And then I went in another direction and now I'm about to start writing in another genre. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that what you've seen? You've interviewed so many writers as part of your &#8216;Author2Author' podcast. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Have you seen this zigzag across people's careers in general?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Sure. Some really they find their thing and they do it. It's like science fiction, science fiction, science fiction, and that's it. Or romance, romance, romance, but other people zigzag, yeah. Absolutely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always say <strong>your job isn't to get out of your comfort zone. It's to keep up with your comfort zone.</strong> I think it's always moving. I think you're always evolving and my job is to keep up with myself. My work is similar, but it's changing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work I do now, it's very similar because it's about creativity and spirituality, but it's growing and it's evolving. I see it in the other writers I've interviewed, how it's grown and changed. Sometimes changed dramatically and sometimes just change subtly because they've really found the thing they love to do. But absolutely. Absolutely, it changes. Sometimes subtly and sometimes absolutely dramatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just interviewed one of my friends, David Laskin. He had been a journalist for a while. He had written a bunch of journalistic narratives, and some of have been bestsellers, and he'd done really well, but he made a huge switch and wrote his first novel at 65 or whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had tried to do it as a memoir and had gotten rejected. He got rejected for the first time in his long writing life. And he was very distraught, but he turned it into a novel and it's doing great. That happened in his 60s. There was a huge departure, but he did it and it was fantastic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, of course. People change it. You've got to follow yourself. You've got to be able to ask yourself, &#8216;<strong>What do I want now? What's interesting to me now? I know this was interesting yesterday, but is it still interesting in the same way?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You're like a tree that keeps growing. I was thinking the tree is such a great analogy. I've got one in my backyard, this apple tree. It's complete, but it keeps growing. It's a total tree. <strong>There's nothing missing from it and yet it keeps changing</strong>. And I think we're like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Again, just coming back on all the authors you've interviewed: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What else have you seen in terms of commonalities of long-term success with a writing career, whether that might be practice, or business stuff?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: It's definitely: <strong>write the thing you love.</strong> That is the common thread through. I've interviewed writers, all shapes and sizes, romance, memoir, poetry, screenplays, literary fiction, whatever and it's always, they just love the thing. They just love that story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that is it. Love is the organizing principle of the universe, it's the fuel that drives creativity, it's the light that you follow through the jungle. It's everything. So that is it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What's the story you love to read, you love to tell? What excites you? What story has your unconditional attention? What are you interested in just because you're interested in it?</strong> That is absolutely the most common thing. All have that in common. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody approaches business differently. Most of them have a writing routine, but not all of them. Some of them don't.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew one woman who wrote novels and the way she wrote them is she only did the dialogue first. She just wrote complete dialogue and then she'd go back and put the prose. And I was like, &#8216;What?' But yeah, that's how she did it. So there's no one way to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I would say do try to <strong>come up with a regular time to write if you can</strong>; it's a good idea, but there are writers who say I do it on the airplane, I do it on the train. I do it wherever I can. So there's always an exception. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing that there is not an exception to, I think, is that the writer loves the story. I know that sounds pat, but you'll never be better at anything than the thing you love to do, period. If you love doing it, that's the best you'll be. So find the story you love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I think that's right. What's interesting is obviously we're recording this. We're still in pandemic times and you write a lot about mindset and obviously creativity. And yet, even if we love writing, a lot of people have suffered from burnout, mental health issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get my inspiration from traveling. So my well is dry, basically, which is one of the reasons I'm looking at different genres because I'm struggling with writing what I normally love. So how do we deal with this? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Should we just force ourselves into it or should we really listen to what's going on and change what we do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: So the question is how do you deal with burnout? Because of the, say the circumstances we're in. Is that what you're asking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: I think of conditions like a surface I stand on. So to go back to the Ōsensei metaphor, remember, he just wanted to be balanced. <strong>The conditions are like the surface.</strong> Sometimes I'm trying to walk on a balance beam and sometimes I'm standing on flat ground. I can always find my balance, but it's easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for you, your creativity, you discovered that you could be inspired by traveling. You found inspiration in that. I would posit to you, your inspiration comes from the same place everybody's does, which is inside you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually didn't come from outside of you, but the experience was one that you found easily sent you into where inspiration was. I can never attribute my complete well-being to my conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there are conditions like being in the middle of a war zone that would be like walking a tight rope for me and I fall off a tight rope, but somewhere is someone who can be at peace in a war zone. I'm not that person now, but I didn't think I was the person who could live with all that rejection and be okay. And I was. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, that was a tight rope and I fell off it, but I learned how to walk it. So I would say <strong>if you're feeling down because conditions have changed, your situation has changed, you never want to feel that your happiness is dependent on something outside your own heart</strong> because that can always go away. And so I would say look in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe this opportunity to do this work is a way of teaching you that you're even more creative than you thought, that you have a wellspring that doesn't rely on that completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There's nothing wrong with it. There are a lot of things I do which help bring out creativity in me, but I never want to mistake the activity for the creativity itself. I love to write. <strong>Writing is great. I love the experience, but still, it's not the writing. I love. It's where I go when I write</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's easiest to go there while writing, but I can go there just sitting in a chair by myself. It's not dependent on the writing. The writing just helps me get there. We're going deep here, Joanna, but I think that's what you're asking. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do I need these conditions to be that way to be creative? And I say no</strong>. Let this experience be an opportunity to learn where your real creativity is, which is really always inside you. It's always coming from within you. Does that make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: It does. Although you also talked about, you have to follow your curiosity and what you love and what you're curious about. I'm basically curious about places and historical things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Here's what I would say then. Then this is what you do too. Because that's not going away, right? Obviously, that's not going away that curiosity. You can't make your curiosity go away. It doesn't go anywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you say, &#8216;Okay, so what do I do with that? I'm used to having the opportunity to literally physically go out and follow that curiosity across the globe. <strong>How does that curiosity express itself now?' Maybe there's a way to express itself that you simply haven't found.</strong> You're so used to being able to do it this other way for obvious reasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, by the way, you'll get to do it again. That'll come back, but maybe there is another way for it to express itself that you haven't discovered yet because you may not have asked the question. You may have assumed it had to go this way, that you simply never asked the question and so you didn't discover the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: In my case, I just decided to travel in my own country. So I'm writing books about my own country instead of other places. But I want to come back to what you said. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>You said, &#8216;I have a lot of things I do that bring out creativity in me.' </strong>What are those things?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Well, doing this. Honestly; <strong>conversations. I play the piano and I write music</strong>. That's a hobby of mine that might've been a profession if I were slightly different person. So that for sure. <strong>I design games, I'm a game designer, role-playing games. And the podcast is creative</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't prepare anything, but it doesn't matter. Some people prepare, some people don't, but I look upon it as just like let's see what's going to happen. I'm so interested to learn about this person. It's what we call <strong>a co-creative experience. I feed off of them, they feed off of me</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversations, workshops, clients, all these things generate creativity in me because I have to think differently about that moment. I have to think differently about the client, I have to think differently about the guest, I have to think differently about the song I'm writing, the game I'm designing. All of it is creative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really, <strong>all of life is creative</strong>. The more I have learned to see my life away from the desk as no different from my life at the desk, the more I'm able to see myself as the author of my life, not just this person dealing with it, and managing it, and reacting to it, the better I've been. <strong>The more I can see the whole life experience as creative, like my life is a blank page, the happier I am </strong>and the more I thrive and the better husband, and father, and friend, I am. I always benefit when I see life itself as a creative act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I agree with you. I think there's so much that can be creative. I guess obviously this show is very much about the business of being a writer as well as the art. And so there you talked about music, about game design. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are these creative play activities or these creative business activities?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: They've been both. I'm an award-winning game designer. We published a bunch of these things through our company, but I also do it for fun. The music is for fun, but I think I secretly wish it was a profession, but I'm shy about my voice, my singing voice, not my speaking voice, but my singing. So I haven't allowed it to become more than an extremely prolific hobby. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try to <strong>see all of my work as play as much as possible</strong>. I say everything I'm paid to do, I would happily do for free. I also like getting paid for it, but that's my framework. I know how to work. I know how to do things that I don't really want to do and get paid for it and I spent a long time doing that, and I'm not interested in that anymore. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I want to see how I can make money doing something that feels like fun. In fact, this is true. I was just doing, so recording the book yesterday at this lovely studio here in Seattle and so I go there and there's the technician in there and then we've got this director who's, I don't know, in LA or something, we're all wired together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've got my headphones on and, Will, the engineer, this really sweet guy, just as we're about to start, he's like, &#8216;Man, isn't this fun? Guys, can you believe we get to be paid to do this? Isn't this great?' And I was like, &#8216;Man, he is singing my tune. He is singing my tune.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I'm with you. I love all this. I love the podcast as well. And I also think it is creative. It's interesting how <strong>people seem to talk about podcasting as marketing, but I think you and I can see that it's actually a creative process</strong>. And as you say, often I change my mind in talking to people or I get ideas when I'm talking to people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your &#8216;Author2Author Magazine' and the podcast and everything, obviously book marketing is a practical part of the business. What are your thoughts on that? You are an author, you have the magazine, you have all this stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you do for book marketing personally?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Actually one of my popular classes, Joanna, I teach is called &#8216;Fearless Marketing.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: What I always say when I teach the class is like I'm not going to actually teach you how to do any marketing. What I'm going to teach you to do is stop hating it because <strong>you can't do it well until you stop hating it</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think about marketing, here's the first thing I think of. I'm trying to define the conversation I'm offering. So I go to a writer's conference. I like to go to writers, conference. Well, once again, I will go to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every classroom is offering a different conversation. Some are talking about how to use social media, another one is like, how do you have a grabber opening? Mine is about the emotional challenges of writing. All the conversations are legitimate. How do you world-build all? These are good conversations for writers to have. This is the conversation I want to have. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try to describe the conversation accurately in the little brochure and say, &#8216;Who wants to come?' And people want to come. Here's the conversation I'm interested in. And so that's the first thing I think it's really helpful for writers, <strong>define the conversation. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you write romance, you want to be with other romance writers who want to think about romance in that way. They want to think about love and relationships in that way. I'm interested in creativity and spirituality. That's a different conversation. You go to a party and it's like they're talking about politics over here, and soccer over there, and science-fiction over there. <strong>What conversation do you want to be a part of? </strong>That's the first thing I say.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>There are so many different ways to market yourself. Find the thing that you are most interested in. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to write essays, blogs. So I do that. And with the theory that if you like my blog, you might like my book. It's the same kind of stuff. And if you listen to my podcast, technically, Joanna, my podcast, it's my platform as you know, that word. My platform is just, I like talking to people who make stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took an agent saying, &#8216;Bill, you have a platform.' I was like, &#8216;No, I don't. I just have a bunch of things I like to do.' And she said, &#8216;That's a platform. What do you think a platform is?' I do the things I like to do. I like talking to people in these interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like doing workshops for people and I like writing essays and I post them on Twitter, and Facebook, and Instagram. Now I'm figuring that out. But I let it be an expression of the stuff that interests me. There's a lot of things you can do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew someone who marketed his book by giving readings at dive bars. That was his big idea. And it worked for him. Another one did his readings on subways. He thought that was a great idea. I'd never do that, but he'll love to do that. It sounded awful, but to him, it was an inspiration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say to your listeners, <strong>try to approach marketing with as much creativity as you can</strong>. It's great having someone like Joanna because you say, &#8216;I really want to dive into social media. That seems so cool.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are people like yourself or lots of people out there who say, &#8216;Okay. I will now teach you how to actually do it, but let's figure out what you're interested in.' There's no one right way to market a book, I don't think, in the same way, there's no right way to write a book. But you've got to find the thing that you think is cool about it and you can't hate it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can't turn your nose up at it. You can't think it's slimy. You can't think, &#8216;Nobody wants to hear from me.' You got to be as interested in, &#8216;<strong>How do I find the people who are interested in the same stuff I'm interested in?</strong> What would be the best way to describe this conversation such that people who are interested in it could recognize it as the kind of conversation they would want to have?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That to me is the friendliest way to think about marketing because that's really what it is. I'm on Twitter sometimes and people would basically saying, &#8216;Buy my book, buy my book.' And I'm like, &#8216;That can't work. What's the what's in it for me?' I've got to know what I'm being offered in this experience you want me to pay for. What's in it for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I can define a conversation, and again, probably like your fiction writers won't see it that way, but it is. It's a conversation. You start a story, the reader finishes it. Think of all you have to leave out in your stories that the reader's imagination fills in. That's a conversation. So that's how I would define it because then you know what it is you're really offering the people that they're getting from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: I like that you say define the conversation because I think <strong>for non-fiction it is a title.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: It's in the title, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Yes. Your book title included the end of self-doubt and I'm like, &#8216;We should talk about that.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For fiction, I almost feel it's the promise of the genre, the title, the cover, the hook. </strong>You have to make it very clear what you're offering and then someone chooses to join that conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: That's right. I've worked a lot with writers and I find that that's one of the most common things, is they don't want to sell. They don't see themselves as salespeople. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see this odious and beneath them and it seems like they don't like being sold but they do like having conversations they want to have. They've got to see it in a friendly way. <strong>Every book's a conversation about something</strong>, about weakness and strength, about love or loss, about what's cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's always about something. From a certain angle. And so define that for yourself. As an author, you are so interested in that conversation. There's no way you can write a book and not be. And so you just got to know there's other people out there who want to have that conversation too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Absolutely. Brilliant. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and your books and everything you do online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>William: The hub of my internet empire, Joanna, is <a href=\"https://www.williamkenower.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">williamkenower.com</a>. So you can go there. And obviously, there's links to books. There's links to my podcast, to &#8216;Author Magazine,' to my coaching. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I remember, I post things I'm doing there in terms of like online workshops and stuff. I am a writing coach. I'm not a book editor, book doctor, but I do help people with their craft and also with the many, many emotional challenges writers face, like why should I do this? Am I any good? That's sort of my sweet spot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I work with people one-on-one with that. And, of course, it's all over Zoom now. Anyway, go to williamkenower.com. And if you want to learn more, it's all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna: Brilliant. Well, thanks so much for your time, Bill. That was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>William: Thank you, Joanna.

Bartolucci</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Dr. Anne Bartolucci is a licensed psychologist and a certified behavioral sleep medicine specialist. She's the author of two non-fiction books, including <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em>, and she's also a best-selling steampunk and urban fantasy author under Cecilia Dominic. Welcome, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Thank you so much, Joanna. I'm really excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Well, this is super important, but before we get into the topic&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a bit more about you and how you got into writing, as well as how you split your creative self between the two different careers.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: That last part of the question is definitely the challenging bit. So I apparently have been writing since I was very little. My mom claims that I wrote my first story when I was two. And I'm sure she has it somewhere. Apparently, what it lacked in plot and character development, it more than made up for in enthusiasm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've written all through school and, of course, creative writing was always a pleasure thing, really more than a career path for me. <strong>I got the message that many people get, &#8216;That's a fun hobby, but you can't really do it for a career.'</strong> So I let it lapse a bit when I was in high school and definitely in college. And then when I got to graduate school, I had a little bit of a setback that I do talk about in the book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went to the bookstore to console myself as we writer types do. And I stumbled across an issue of &#8216;Writer's Digest Magazine.' And it just blew my mind because I was like, &#8216;Holy crap, people get paid for this.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I picked up my creative writing again and did it through grad school as a self-sanity thing. And then started working on my novel, which, of course, that first novel took me like four or five years. And then I pitched that for a long time, and wrote some other novels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, that one sold to Samhain Publishing in 2013. So I started out traditionally published, and they were a mid-sized genre outfit out of Cincinnati, Ohio, mostly doing romance and associated genres. I had 7 books with them when they closed in 2017 when I got my rights back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been indie pubbed since then until just recently, when I signed a three-book contract with Flagstaff Publishing for a time-travel action-adventure series, and those should start coming out next year. So I guess at this point, I can call myself hybrid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for splitting my creative self between the two, <strong>I used to try to keep the two very, very separate, hence the pen name. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started my online writing with a wine blog. And, of course, I live in a part of the United States where some people have some very interesting attitudes towards alcohol. Like in my state, Georgia, we weren't even allowed buy alcohol on Sundays until about 10 years ago. Now we still have to wait until 11:30 on Sundays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: After church, but, of course, I guess if you have communion, you do get your wine!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. Especially for those of us in churches where they do have real wine for communion, although not since the pandemic interestingly. So, make your brunch plans accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: You do manage these two very differently. Do you work as a psychologist now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I do. <strong>I have my own private practice, Atlanta Insomnia and Behavioral Health Services</strong>. I started that in 2008. At this point, we've grown. It's me and a full-time other psychologist and a part-time psychologist, had to bring somebody else on because we got very busy over the past year, as you can imagine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's a full load of patients and all the administrative stuff. I realized with telehealth that <strong>I can't do as many telehealth sessions in a day as I do in-person sessions just because it is more of a physical strain on my eyes</strong>. <strong>It's more of a brain strain because I'm having to extrapolate a lot more information from a lot fewer cues</strong>. And so I cut back on those hours and have tried to expand my writing hours, which has gone with mixed success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's so interesting that you said that with telehealth, presumably through Zoom or whatever, Skype, makes you more tired because I feel like before the pandemic people assumed that it was easy to do this stuff. But now there seems to be this understanding that it is very tiring, and speaking through Zoom is just or even more tiring than doing it in person, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you think that there is now the acceptance of how tiring online communication is?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I hope so. It's going to be interesting to see what happens with insurance reimbursements as we move forward because they're trying to pay us less because they're like, &#8216;Oh, well, you don't have as much overhead if you're just sitting at home with your computer.' I don't know that they're really thinking about the balance of it's a lot harder physically. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are not necessarily noticing it, but other people, especially those whose whole lives have moved on to these video platforms definitely notice. We have this term Zoom fatigue to describe all of it. Even though we don't use Zoom, we use a HIPAA compliant platform that comes through our electronic health record system, but it definitely is a valid thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I've heard you talk on your podcast about how you were doing online events that you have cut back. I've done the same thing because it's no fun to sit and talk to your computer for five hours giving a workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Exactly. You and I recording this without the video on but some people say, &#8216;I want the video on so I can watch your body language.' And I'm like, &#8216;But I don't want to have to look at your body language because it's tiring.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <strong>even though we're in front of the computer now, I feel like having the video off and the lights turned down can really help</strong>. But, of course, you can't do that in a psychological appointment. It's like, &#8216;Excuse me, any way to turn the lights down?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Not really. And then patients get really disappointed if they can't see my cat when I'm working from home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, there you go. Yeah. Anyway, let's get into the topic, which is we're talking about sleep. It's a crazy question, given how we have so little of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why is sleep so important for mental health and happiness, as well as creativity for writers?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: If you think about it, we know a lot of why we need sleep <strong>because of what happens when we don't sleep</strong>. So if you're not sleeping or if you've had a rough night, we notice that we're not as sharp the next day. We notice that it's a lot harder to communicate maybe. It's harder to focus on things, and we're grumpy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It's really hard to be creative when you're in this foggy, grumpy, irritable state</strong>, especially if that's your normal state because you haven't been getting good sleep for a long time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was at a convention this past weekend here in Atlanta, and I heard at least two people talk about how when they come to a thorny problem in their writing and their manuscripts, they will think about it before they go to bed. And then often when they wake up, they'll have a solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all these <strong>interesting mental processes that happen when we sleep</strong>. Our brain doesn't just shut off. It is working through the night and it's able to work in different ways while we sleep than it does during the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And lack of sleep or sleep issues, how is that related to depression and mental health? Especially during the pandemic, you mentioned how much more work you've got now. Even people who didn't have mental health problems, now do. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does sleep play into depression and mental health?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: A lot of times people look at anxiety and depression and sleep and think, &#8216;Oh, well, sleep problems are secondary to anxiety and depression.' And at this point, we don't even talk about primary versus secondary insomnia because we have enough research that shows that <strong>if people aren't getting enough sleep, they're more likely to develop anxiety or they're more likely to have relapses back into depression</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about this part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which basically helps the executive of the brain know what to pay attention to. So if your frontal lobes are your executive, the prefrontal cortex are the administrative assistant sitting outside the executive office saying, &#8216;Okay, pay attention to this. Don't pay attention to that.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we are sleep-deprived, the prefrontal cortex actually is less active. So the secretary is just letting everything through, including the emotions from the more &#8216;primitive' part of the brain. I don't like calling it the primitive part of the brain because it's still very necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's just say the older, more mature part of the brain is letting everything through, and so it's a lot harder for our brains to sort out what's important. What should we react to? What should we not react to? Which leads to <strong>more experiences of negative emotion and with anxiety, and we're focusing on things that make us anxious and worried</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's crazy how important it is, and yet how much we all struggle. And so what are the different types of insomnia? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>People say, &#8216;I have insomnia,' but it's not just one thing, is it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: No. We divide insomnia into a few different types. There's sleep-onset insomnia, which is <strong>difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night. And then there is sleep maintenance insomnia, which is where people have long awakenings during the night</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or <strong>terminal insomnia</strong>, which I tend to lump in with sleep maintenance insomnia, which is where people just wake up before their alarm or before they're supposed to be up and they're awake for a long time and never go back to sleep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get back to your question about why it's become worse during the pandemic, this feeds into the question about how to improve our sleep. One facet of it is that <strong>people used to have bigger barriers between the stressors of the day</strong>, work stressors, school stressors, and then home life. I've been listening to your podcast on the anthropology for world-building. And in your intro, you talk about <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St. Cuthbert</a> and how he went to his island, and he put his wall up so he didn't have to look at his day job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was thinking, &#8216;Cuthbert, dude, I am right there with you,' because as soon as I could get back into my physical office, I did. Because <strong>it's really hard to turn off the brain, to turn off the work brain when we are working from home</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here in Atlanta, a lot of people have really long commutes. And so they lost that. So while they might have been able to sleep a little bit more, they were having a harder time drawing that separation between work-life and home and sleep life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Absolutely. And we'll come back to how we can improve sleep. I just wanted to return to the different types of insomnia because in my family, there was always this story. My granddad, my mom's dad could fall asleep anywhere. And my mom would tell the story of he would go out to hang out the washing and he'd sort of hang himself over the washing line and he'd fall asleep there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: <strong>The family story is we can fall asleep anywhere. I absolutely was that person really until a couple of years ago</strong>. And I'm in that certain bracket of age where hormonal changes start to impact my sleep. So I do often wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. and I don't go back to sleep. And I've always been a morning person, but anything with a 3 in it can be a little bit annoying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yeah. That's early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: But then it's funny because I've started to tell the difference between that kind of waking up. And then <strong>when I wake up because of stress or anxiety or reasons where my mind&#8230;it's either my mind or it's my hormones</strong>. I have different reactions to that kind of sleeplessness. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is that a common thing for people to have these different reasons for insomnia at different times of their life?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. As you mentioned, especially for us women and I am right there with you in that bracket. And nobody ever talks about perimenopause, they always talk about menopause. So you think you're safe until you're 50, but you're really not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: No, you're 10 years behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes, exactly. It's one of the things that people think that they should be able to just go to sleep and sleep straight for seven to eight hours and never wake up. And the thing is that <strong>it is normal for adults to have awakenings during the night</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hope is that if you do have an awakening, okay, maybe you get up, you go pee, or you roll over, or you think for a couple of seconds or a few minutes, and then you fall back asleep. That's normal. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>If you are waking up for more than a half-hour total during the night, that is considered insomnia.</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And as for the different reasons, sure we can get into them a little bit during insomnia treatment, but we basically do very similar things regardless of why people are waking up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's interesting. Again, I do like a drink. I've been quite open about that on the podcast, but I have noticed that I used to really like a Pinot noir, and I've almost completely stopped drinking red wine now because I can feel the impact on my sleep, whereas I'm quite fine with Prosecco or Rose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh my gosh, me too. I have really cut back on my red wine drinking. And you see my last name, this is my last name. This is not my husband's last name. I feel like I should be able to drink those good Italian reds, but yes. More than two glasses, or sometimes even more than one glass and it comes back to get me later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's almost <strong>being much more self-aware around the things that make a difference</strong> in those. I tried valerian tea for a while. That did make a difference for a bit, and then it stopped working. So I gave up on that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there's a difference, like you said, about the acceptance. It's like, okay, this is just part of life. And I'm lucky in that I don't have any kind of day job so I can work. I often will just start work at 4:00 a.m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And then I just stop and by 4:00 p.m, I'm like, &#8216;Okay, pretty much it's all over, red rover.' I feel like the anxiety about not sleeping can often just build up and build up and then make it harder to sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do we get over that fear of not sleeping and maybe accept where we are at?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Definitely. That is honestly a lot of what we treat in my practice is anxiety over not sleeping. And <strong>that's really come to the forefront in the past year, not just with the pandemic where everybody's just more anxious and the anxiety is attaching to whatever it can</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also for the people who have had COVID and who have had these really rough weeks of sleep and it's being perpetuated by the fact that yes, that was such a rough week, it was a traumatic experience. And they're afraid that it's going to happen again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There is this big sleep myth that we must get eight hours</strong>. We see that number everywhere, eight hours of sleep. Whereas that's an average. The National Institute for Health here recommends that adults get between seven and nine hours with the very often not mentioned caveat that some people can sleep safely on average for an hour outside of those hills. So it's a bell curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adult sleep range may be even as wide as 6 to 10 hours. And another thing to consider is that we need different amounts of sleep on different nights. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have a range of sleep that you know your body likes. I know my body likes between seven and a half to nine hours of sleep a night. And if you think about it, that's a pretty big range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on nights when maybe I've been more active, I have to admit I have not once logged 10 hours a day for 4 days straight ever. But you probably slept great on those nights when you were walking all day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, I don't know. No, I didn't, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: You didn't?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: No. Again, I fall asleep very easily and I would fall asleep. And for people listening, that was the <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St Cuthbert's Way pilgrimage</a> I did recently. I fell asleep very quickly, but then, again, I would wake up at 3:00 a.m. So I'd find that almost the being physically tired doesn't actually necessarily help with that waking up insomnia. Although I don't like the phrase terminal insomnia, that sounds pretty serious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I know. That sounds like something that might come up in one of your books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Exactly. Yeah. Maybe that's giving me an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And we should say that seven hours to nine hours or whatever, that also includes these normal periods of waking for short amounts of time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does anyone really sleep without waking up after a certain age?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: It's very rare for adults. I have had patients who have said that they've gotten there or that before their insomnia developed a couple of years ago, that's what they were doing. But I suspect they were waking up briefly and did not remember it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, when somebody is sleeping seven, eight, nine hours straight, that's when they are in their childhood, teens, maybe early 20s, or late 20s. Generally once we get past 30, we are going to have small awakenings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Any other common sleep myths?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: The one that really irritates me is when should you go to bed every night at the same time. That is not the case because a lot of times <strong>if people are going to bed before they are truly sleepy, they're going to lie awake in bed</strong>, which then teaches your body and your brain that bed is for being awake, not for being asleep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a lot of people who perhaps their problems started because they heard that eight-hour number. They said, &#8216;Okay, I'm getting up at 6:00 in the morning for work. That means I need to be in bed by 10:00, even though my body isn't getting tired until 11:00 or 12:00.' And so they ended up getting themselves into trouble with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Some people really are night owls, aren't they? Their body wants to be awake in the dark. And it seems such an unacceptable way to live in the modern world, and yet it feels like there are a proportion of people who are that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Some people really are night owls, aren't they?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. That's another one of those things that really irritates me is that idea that the ideal sleep schedule is from 10:00 to 6:00. And there is there's even information out there that, oh, well, you're only going to get really good sleep in those hours before midnight. And that's really not the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We all have different circadian rhythms.</strong> It's one of my big soapboxes in sleep that <strong>we should be able to live and work according to our natural rhythms rather than being shoe-horned into whatever this ideal is</strong>. Honestly, that's one of the reasons why I am self-employed, so that I can set my own hours because I'm a little phase delayed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't think I've ever gotten up regularly at 6:00 since I was in high school in the '90s and had to get up early because I had to have that perfect '90s hairstyle. That fell off quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I love that. You used &#8216;phase delayed'. I think that's brilliant because you're right, it's not necessarily a night owl, someone who wants to be awake when it's dark. It's that just even a couple of hours difference to even your potential, your partner, your kids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are going to be difficult things in relationships is setting when that happens. I also find a lot of writers were into this because they can't necessarily work normal job hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I have found writing is a career you can do when you're phase delayed.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Exactly. It's perfect for us. And there's another one of those sleep myths versus <strong>writing myths is that the best writing time is first thing in the morning </strong>whereas for me, my brain just does not work like that. It works better for me to write after dinner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about this in the book <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em>, that <strong>I struggled for so long trying to fit into that (so-called) ideal mode</strong> of, &#8216;I must get up early. I must write for an hour before I go to work. I must do this, this, and this in order to be successful.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finally, I threw all those rules out the window</strong> and thought, &#8216;You know what? Let me just write when it works for me.' That is when I'm getting my NaNoWriMo words done this month is after dinner and it pushes my bedtime a little bit later, and that's okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: That's great you say that because, well, I'm one of those people who does write in the morning and sometimes really early, but now I think this is so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deanwesleysmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dean Wesley Smith</a>, who's been on the show and he's a virtual mentor for me. And he, I think, starts about 11:00 p.m. His writing phase is definitely over the night. And it's so interesting to hear that. Some people listening that it doesn't matter when it is. We're all different. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's talk about how can we improve our sleep. The early bits or sleep rituals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do we improve with falling asleep?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: If you think about it, we are behavioral creatures. Even though we have evolved, we are still very behavioral creatures and <strong>our bodies and our minds like our routines</strong>. Admittedly, some people intellectually like routines a little bit better than others, but generally, we can train ourselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One big way to improve falling asleep is to <strong>give yourself adequate time and space to wind down</strong>. So think about those computers back in the '90s. You remember they took such a long time to shut down all of their various processes that we chose a song to play while they did that. Our brains are kind of like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving ourselves <strong>at least an hour of no screens</strong> because screens have that blue light that is activating to our brain and also a lot of the content on screens, even though we might tell ourselves it's relaxing, it can be activating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Especially in the pandemic, the doom scrolling. &#8216;Oh, just check it. Check it one more time.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh gosh, yes. I would have to say that's probably the biggest piece of advice that I've been giving since, oh, about say 2016 in this country, which is to really <strong>limit your news exposure</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I used to wake up in the morning and check the news and twitter. And that borders on addiction and I completely get it in my own behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read on a Kindle Paperwhite, which has an e-ink screen and I dial down the brightness all the way, and because it's only black and white&#8230;well, it's not white, it's kind of dark gray by the time that happens. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is using eInk screens like a Kindle or Kobo device okay?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. <strong>As long as you have dialed it back so that there is no glow at all</strong>, that's great. I got the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32PNRI4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kindle Oasis</a> for that reason because that is the one where you can dial it completely dark and you do need a light to read it. So you can see if perhaps the Paperwhite is still giving you enough light that it could disturb sleep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you say you have no trouble falling asleep, but it's interesting after having looked at tens of thousands of sleep diaries at this point, <strong>late-night light exposure can definitely impact sleep later on</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I also wear an eye mask, quite a thick <strong>eye mask and I also wear earplugs</strong>. My husband does maybe snore. And so I pretty much cut out all light in that way as well and sound. So I go into my little sensory deprivation tank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: My husband maybe snores too. I understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Does that help? Is that something you recommend for people, the eye mask, earplugs combination?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Only if they are really sensitive to light and noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I think I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Otherwise, we <strong>try to make sleep as simple as possible and so we try to not have too much extraneous things that need to happen in order for somebody to sleep</strong>, which is also another reason why we recommend that people not use sleep medication and <strong>we spend a lot of time getting people off-sleep medication</strong>. And that includes over-the-counter things like diphenhydramine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we were talking about before, melatonin, we can get that very easily here. I know you guys can't. But when you're taking something, you're giving yourself the signal that, &#8216;Hey, I can't sleep on my own.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I must say when I come to the U.S., it does shock me. I know lots of people who take something to go to sleep and then take something in the morning to kind of get them going or that kind of thing. And that medication, it must be very easy to get hooked on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have thought at times going to a doctor and getting something. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But what I found is that getting rid of the anxiety around sleep has actually just helped a lot.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Your book is full of all the things so that you understand what's natural, as opposed to some sort of pop news tells you it's normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Right. And the pop news will just take the very simplest thing without the context and try to put that out there as a hard-and-fast rule. With a few exceptions, there really aren't any hard-and-fast rules that are going to work the same way for every single person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: There's one that says don't eat or drink X number of hours before bed. And then another one that says have some hot milk with honey or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about eating and/or drinking before bed?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: That's a great question because that's another one of those things that's super individual. <strong>You want to find this balance where you're not going to bed hungry, but you're also not going to bed stuffed.</strong> You want to be, shall we say, comfortably satisfied when you go to bed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, having hot milk helps with that. Maybe there's probably not enough tryptophan in there to make a real big difference, but it has some carbs and it has some protein, which keeps you from having those blood sugar spikes. So there's probably something to that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, for certain people, it works, and for other people, it doesn't. So for example, if somebody has reflux issues, they probably don't want to be drinking a glass of warm milk before bed because that's going to then disturb them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Any other things on improving sleep?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Since you talked about, or since you asked about food, exercise is another one of those things that there's a lot of conflicting information about. We hear you should not exercise close to bedtime, and that's another one of those really individual variables. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas some people, especially if they are a bit more anxious, tend to benefit from exercise closer to bedtime because it's helping to burn off some of that cortisol that's built up during the day from their anxiety. So for some people that works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise<strong> think about how exercise affects you</strong>. Some people exercise wakes them up. They're the ones who are at the gym at 5:00, 6:00 in the morning and they're great for the rest of the day. I wish I was one of those people. I'm one of those people where exercise wears me out. If I exercise first thing in the morning, like I did today, I am probably going to be a little tired for the rest of the day, but you know what, at least I got it over with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, that's interesting. I always exercise in the morning pretty much. After lunchtime, I'm not interested. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's good to know that there are no rules. There's different categories and it's like each part of us fits into a different category. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We're all individuals, which is a relief, I suppose.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. I would say the only hard-and-fast rules for sleep if you want to know where to start with the basics are: <strong>try to wake up at around the same time every day</strong> because we have these circadian rhythms, these internal clocks that tell us when to be awake, when to be asleep, when to be hungry. If you want your body to know when it's supposed to be asleep, it needs to know when it's supposed to wake up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's why they say get up at the same time every single day. It's not just to torture you on weekends like a lot of people think. On the other hand, don't go to bed until you're sleepy. And then yes, cut out screens an hour before bedtime and have a routine. I would say those are the basics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are tons of other interfering things that happen that keep people from sleeping, which I talk about more of those in the book, but I want to say if you want just the core rules, those would be them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Again, simple, but it's not easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: But such is life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I'm very thankful that I sleep well because I will admit the getting up at the same time, I try to give myself an hour range and no more, although sometimes that can be difficult, especially after I've gone through a period where I'm now in introvert exhaustion. Like I mentioned, I was at a convention last weekend and we're recording this in early November, which means that we just had daylight savings time go off. And, oh my gosh, that extra hour of sleep on Sunday morning of convention was the best thing ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: You do have a section on mindfulness and meditation, but you do also acknowledge it's not for everyone because this is something that people say. My husband goes through phases when he will meditate every day and he finds it very useful, but it's not something I've found useful. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a bit about mindfulness if people want to try it or some of the alternatives.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I think you bring up a great question because there is a little bit of a distinction in that mindfulness is more of a way of approaching reality whereas meditation is a type of mindfulness activity. There are a lot of other different mindfulness activities that people can do if meditation just really isn't their thing. And that's fine. Sometimes it's not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had so many people tell me that they have failed at meditation where just to make a little distinction, a lot of times people think that the purpose of meditation is to clear your mind. Our minds don't do that, their job is to think, they're really good at it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is to <strong>get practiced at noticing when the mind is wandering and then bringing it back and noticing when it's wandering and bringing it back.</strong> By doing that over and over and over again during the practices, you then learn to better do that outside of the practices in times when it's more important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you wake up and your mind starts wandering in a not-so-useful direction, you're able to catch it more quickly before it gets as far as making you be up for hours. I do like to try to draw that distinction because there is so much misconception about mindfulness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm a regular meditator. I have found it to be very useful, but there are other aspects of mindfulness that I've found to be just as useful outside of that. For example, <strong>non-judgemental observation is a core mindfulness principle</strong>, and you've already talked about applying it, perhaps without realizing it, in that <strong>when you wake up, you don't get upset about being awake, you accept it. You approach that non-judgementally</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: That's made a big difference to me, actually. And, in fact, talking about our hormonal phase of life, I'm taking that attitude now a lot more about a lot of things and also having had COVID, and all the things I've been through this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maybe acceptance is just an attitude towards life in general.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Right. Exactly. I was thinking about this question and a lot of times people want to use mindfulness for stress reduction, which it's very useful, but if that's not really your philosophy or your thing, there are a couple of questions to ask that might be good alternatives that are still tangentially related. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, when you find yourself getting upset over something, one thing to ask that comes maybe more out of the cognitive therapy world is, &#8216;<strong>Where am I blowing up the drama?</strong>&#8216; Because as humans, we're wired for drama and our minds will automatically do that without us realizing it. That's why we like stories. Because they're full of drama. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tell ourselves stories that might be more full of drama than they need to be. Maybe we're filling in what other people are thinking without checking with them or without really knowing how often do we do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to approach it is, &#8216;Okay, <strong>is this thought useful or not useful?</strong>&#8216; And it sort of relates back to your interview with <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/09/06/strengths-for-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Becca Syme</a>, with question the premise. &#8216;Is this a useful premise for me to be operating from, or is this a useful thought for me to be engaging with and chewing on right now?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Right now is the point, isn't it? It's like, &#8216;Okay, I've woken up and I'm thinking about this, this, this, and this. Maybe I could leave that till later rather than focusing on it.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now also, I do find <strong>breathing exercises</strong> useful because I'm someone I do hold my breath. When I think, when I do a lot of things, I hold my breath. It's on my list, learn breath work. But I have learned some basic breathing, like belly breathing and things like that to four-point breathing or whatever it's called and counting breaths. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I have found breathing exercises to be quite useful in some ways.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes, that's one thing I definitely do with all of my patients is we all start off with diaphragmatic breathing or as you call it, belly breathing, not only because it helps to calm the mind, but because breathing like that, breathing from your belly and keeping the chest still helps to turn on the parasympathetic or calming part of the autonomic nervous system, which then helps us to come out of fight or flight more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Fantastic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: The book has a lot about mindset and you talk about your author experiences in the examples, which I think is brilliant. It's very revealing. And I appreciate what you share in the book. Maybe you could share just a couple of things. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What have you learned from your indie author journey that informs your work as a psychologist?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, that is a great question because typically people want to know how being a psychologist has helped me be a better writer. So that is a very creative way to ask the question. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say first, just being a writer has helped me to be a better psychotherapist because I'm a lot more creative. I believe, as a result, <strong>I'm able to look at things in perhaps different ways</strong> than what we were taught and then how. I'm able to explain things in different ways if people don't quite get the traditional wording and the traditional language. So that has definitely helped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly, as you know and as you read in the book, <strong>my indie author journey has had plenty of ups and downs</strong>. It's helped me be a better psychologist because it's helped me to accept for that there are going to be ups and downs, that there are going to be successes and failures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it's helped me to be a little, maybe not a lot, but a little bit <strong>more tolerant of uncertainty in my business</strong> and also know, &#8216;Okay, well, this thing didn't work. It doesn't mean I'm a failure. It just means I need to try something else.' I can bring that to my patients as well, which is, &#8216;Okay, you know what, so you tried this thing, didn't work. It's okay. Try something different.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I think that's really important. And do you enjoy the fact that you have this very different day job because sometimes there's this feeling in the community and I do try and dispel it, but I am a full-time creative entrepreneur. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Having a day job is also a really great thing because it means the entire pressure isn't on your creative work as such?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. I was so relieved to hear, I think, I can't remember if it was you or Mark who was reading that part in <em><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Relaxed Author</a></em>, which is if you have a day job that you like, or that works for you, it is perfectly okay to not want to be a full-time author. I had already felt that and I was like, &#8216;Yes, validation.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And to be honest, it's actually may be easier and better because it separates what you said at the beginning about a problem between separating the barrier between home and work. This is something I just struggle with so much. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you can separate your life into these different areas, both of which fulfill you in a different way, that just seems magic.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I know you've talked about how hard you found it to write from home during the pandemic because you like to write at coffee shops, and I am the same way. I prefer to not write in the space where I see my clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's another thing that I have found that's nice about writing in the evening because I put the day job to bed at 6:00 or 7:00. We're done. No more day job stuff. No more emails or looking at the calendar or anything like that, and at least I try to follow that rule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then after that, my mental shift is switching my home office to, &#8216;Okay, this is my writing space now.' I have my headphones and my music and the cat's always there regardless of which job it is. I have my wine. Obviously, I don't have that while I'm seeing patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Do you find that having the different names helps you switch your headspace?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. Although it's funny since turning 40, my Cecilia Dominic persona, I would go to conventions. We're very fortunate to have a lot of local fantasy and pop culture conventions here in the Atlanta area. The biggest one is, of course, Dragon Con, but we have a bunch of smaller ones as well and across the Southeast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would go to conventions and I found for a while that <strong>Cecilia Dominic was a lot more outgoing, a lot more confident maybe,</strong> a lot more just&#8230;I'm trying to think of the right word. Maybe just like genuinely an author persona, whereas Anne Bartolucci is like more of a therapist persona, but <strong>since I've turned 40, the two have pretty much merged</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, that's interesting. You're on the show with both names but I am interviewing Anne, not Cecilia, but you're able to reconcile them both.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are you more comfortable sharing your professional side now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes, now I'm much better able to reconcile the two of them. And I call the Cecilia Dominic persona the not-so-secret alter ego because if it's appropriate, of course, I will share that with my patients and here in my office where I see patients physically, although still only about a third of them coming in in-person, I have my ego shelf on the top of my bookshelf with all my books. So they see them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: That's great. And, of course, <strong>no judgment for anyone who doesn't want to share their alter egos and their writer names</strong>, but obviously, I did this myself and I find it useful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last question before we wind up, we're almost out of time, but so now, obviously, you're marketing non-fiction books and also your steampunk and urban fantasy under Cecilia. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What differences have you found between the writing and the book marketing processes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: So I don't know if this is the case for you, but for me, writing non-fiction is a lot harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, it's the opposite for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I thought you might say that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With non-fiction, when you get stuck, you can't just kill somebody off.</strong> The police don't like that. So I get non-fiction to be a lot harder. And a lot of the things I talk about in the books, in the book like perfectionism and procrastination and imposter syndrome, I experienced while I was writing that book because I was trying to be as genuine as possible and as honest and upfront about my struggles as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I had to recognize and resist that little voice that kept saying, &#8216;Oh, nobody really cares what you have to say.' </strong>When I'm writing as Cecilia, of course, it's fictional worlds, fictional characters, and I feel like maybe they're a little bit more separated for me. So I would say that would be the difference in the writing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as for marketing, <strong>I've definitely learned a lot about marketing from being an indie author</strong>, which has helped me with my non-fiction and even my practice. I would never have thought to run Facebook ads, for example, for my practice had I not done it first as an indie author.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still do mostly the paid ads for the fiction. I have a newsletter that I've had for a while. Talking to other authors, doing newsletter swaps and things like that, whereas for non-fiction, it's definitely been more of a strategy of let me get this book into the hands of people who can recommend it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I send copies to a bunch of my referral sources and that was one reason that I put it out in 2019 or in 2020, which was because I knew they needed resources for their patients. And so I was so busy at the practice, like, &#8216;Okay, I can't do a lot of publicity for this right now, but let me just get it out there so the people who need it can have it as a resource.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I'm also doing podcast interviews like this one. I did one for the &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.jeffreyshaw.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Self-Employed Life</a>&#8216; a few weeks ago that just recently dropped. I ended up not being consistent about pitching other podcasts, but I'm going to get back to it. So yes, getting the non-fiction into the hands of experts and people who can recommend it is that strategy, whereas the fiction, it's more of, I guess, a wide wider strategy of getting it directly to consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I think that is interesting. And, of course, the book is <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em>. Although if you don't feel like an overachiever, it's still useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I'm sure you called it that, but it's also if you feel like you're an underachiever, it's also useful. Brilliant. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and your books online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: You can find my Cecilia Dominic self at my website, ceciliadominic.com. And that is <a href=\"https://www.ceciliadominic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ceciliadominic.com</a> since there are two ways to spell Cecilia. Mine's one with an I. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em> with the blog that I update occasionally, that one is at <a href=\"http://overachieverbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">overachieverbook.com</a>. I was really excited when I got that website domain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if you're interested in me or my practice, if you're here in the States, of course, we can do telehealth with anybody in Georgia. And we're also SIPAC  providers, which means that we serve several other states as well. So you can find us, and I say us, not as the royal we, but since there are three of us, at <a href=\"https://www.sleepyintheatl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sleepyintheatl.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Fantastic. Thanks so much for your time, Anne. That was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Thank you, Joanna.

Bartolucci</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Dr. Anne Bartolucci is a licensed psychologist and a certified behavioral sleep medicine specialist. She's the author of two non-fiction books, including <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em>, and she's also a best-selling steampunk and urban fantasy author under Cecilia Dominic. Welcome, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Thank you so much, Joanna. I'm really excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Well, this is super important, but before we get into the topic&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a bit more about you and how you got into writing, as well as how you split your creative self between the two different careers.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: That last part of the question is definitely the challenging bit. So I apparently have been writing since I was very little. My mom claims that I wrote my first story when I was two. And I'm sure she has it somewhere. Apparently, what it lacked in plot and character development, it more than made up for in enthusiasm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I've written all through school and, of course, creative writing was always a pleasure thing, really more than a career path for me. <strong>I got the message that many people get, &#8216;That's a fun hobby, but you can't really do it for a career.'</strong> So I let it lapse a bit when I was in high school and definitely in college. And then when I got to graduate school, I had a little bit of a setback that I do talk about in the book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went to the bookstore to console myself as we writer types do. And I stumbled across an issue of &#8216;Writer's Digest Magazine.' And it just blew my mind because I was like, &#8216;Holy crap, people get paid for this.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I picked up my creative writing again and did it through grad school as a self-sanity thing. And then started working on my novel, which, of course, that first novel took me like four or five years. And then I pitched that for a long time, and wrote some other novels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, that one sold to Samhain Publishing in 2013. So I started out traditionally published, and they were a mid-sized genre outfit out of Cincinnati, Ohio, mostly doing romance and associated genres. I had 7 books with them when they closed in 2017 when I got my rights back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been indie pubbed since then until just recently, when I signed a three-book contract with Flagstaff Publishing for a time-travel action-adventure series, and those should start coming out next year. So I guess at this point, I can call myself hybrid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for splitting my creative self between the two, <strong>I used to try to keep the two very, very separate, hence the pen name. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started my online writing with a wine blog. And, of course, I live in a part of the United States where some people have some very interesting attitudes towards alcohol. Like in my state, Georgia, we weren't even allowed buy alcohol on Sundays until about 10 years ago. Now we still have to wait until 11:30 on Sundays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: After church, but, of course, I guess if you have communion, you do get your wine!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. Especially for those of us in churches where they do have real wine for communion, although not since the pandemic interestingly. So, make your brunch plans accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: You do manage these two very differently. Do you work as a psychologist now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I do. <strong>I have my own private practice, Atlanta Insomnia and Behavioral Health Services</strong>. I started that in 2008. At this point, we've grown. It's me and a full-time other psychologist and a part-time psychologist, had to bring somebody else on because we got very busy over the past year, as you can imagine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's a full load of patients and all the administrative stuff. I realized with telehealth that <strong>I can't do as many telehealth sessions in a day as I do in-person sessions just because it is more of a physical strain on my eyes</strong>. <strong>It's more of a brain strain because I'm having to extrapolate a lot more information from a lot fewer cues</strong>. And so I cut back on those hours and have tried to expand my writing hours, which has gone with mixed success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's so interesting that you said that with telehealth, presumably through Zoom or whatever, Skype, makes you more tired because I feel like before the pandemic people assumed that it was easy to do this stuff. But now there seems to be this understanding that it is very tiring, and speaking through Zoom is just or even more tiring than doing it in person, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you think that there is now the acceptance of how tiring online communication is?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I hope so. It's going to be interesting to see what happens with insurance reimbursements as we move forward because they're trying to pay us less because they're like, &#8216;Oh, well, you don't have as much overhead if you're just sitting at home with your computer.' I don't know that they're really thinking about the balance of it's a lot harder physically. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are not necessarily noticing it, but other people, especially those whose whole lives have moved on to these video platforms definitely notice. We have this term Zoom fatigue to describe all of it. Even though we don't use Zoom, we use a HIPAA compliant platform that comes through our electronic health record system, but it definitely is a valid thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I've heard you talk on your podcast about how you were doing online events that you have cut back. I've done the same thing because it's no fun to sit and talk to your computer for five hours giving a workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Exactly. You and I recording this without the video on but some people say, &#8216;I want the video on so I can watch your body language.' And I'm like, &#8216;But I don't want to have to look at your body language because it's tiring.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <strong>even though we're in front of the computer now, I feel like having the video off and the lights turned down can really help</strong>. But, of course, you can't do that in a psychological appointment. It's like, &#8216;Excuse me, any way to turn the lights down?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Not really. And then patients get really disappointed if they can't see my cat when I'm working from home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, there you go. Yeah. Anyway, let's get into the topic, which is we're talking about sleep. It's a crazy question, given how we have so little of it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why is sleep so important for mental health and happiness, as well as creativity for writers?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: If you think about it, we know a lot of why we need sleep <strong>because of what happens when we don't sleep</strong>. So if you're not sleeping or if you've had a rough night, we notice that we're not as sharp the next day. We notice that it's a lot harder to communicate maybe. It's harder to focus on things, and we're grumpy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It's really hard to be creative when you're in this foggy, grumpy, irritable state</strong>, especially if that's your normal state because you haven't been getting good sleep for a long time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was at a convention this past weekend here in Atlanta, and I heard at least two people talk about how when they come to a thorny problem in their writing and their manuscripts, they will think about it before they go to bed. And then often when they wake up, they'll have a solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all these <strong>interesting mental processes that happen when we sleep</strong>. Our brain doesn't just shut off. It is working through the night and it's able to work in different ways while we sleep than it does during the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And lack of sleep or sleep issues, how is that related to depression and mental health? Especially during the pandemic, you mentioned how much more work you've got now. Even people who didn't have mental health problems, now do. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does sleep play into depression and mental health?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: A lot of times people look at anxiety and depression and sleep and think, &#8216;Oh, well, sleep problems are secondary to anxiety and depression.' And at this point, we don't even talk about primary versus secondary insomnia because we have enough research that shows that <strong>if people aren't getting enough sleep, they're more likely to develop anxiety or they're more likely to have relapses back into depression</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about this part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which basically helps the executive of the brain know what to pay attention to. So if your frontal lobes are your executive, the prefrontal cortex are the administrative assistant sitting outside the executive office saying, &#8216;Okay, pay attention to this. Don't pay attention to that.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we are sleep-deprived, the prefrontal cortex actually is less active. So the secretary is just letting everything through, including the emotions from the more &#8216;primitive' part of the brain. I don't like calling it the primitive part of the brain because it's still very necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's just say the older, more mature part of the brain is letting everything through, and so it's a lot harder for our brains to sort out what's important. What should we react to? What should we not react to? Which leads to <strong>more experiences of negative emotion and with anxiety, and we're focusing on things that make us anxious and worried</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's crazy how important it is, and yet how much we all struggle. And so what are the different types of insomnia? </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>People say, &#8216;I have insomnia,' but it's not just one thing, is it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: No. We divide insomnia into a few different types. There's sleep-onset insomnia, which is <strong>difficulty falling asleep at the beginning of the night. And then there is sleep maintenance insomnia, which is where people have long awakenings during the night</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or <strong>terminal insomnia</strong>, which I tend to lump in with sleep maintenance insomnia, which is where people just wake up before their alarm or before they're supposed to be up and they're awake for a long time and never go back to sleep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get back to your question about why it's become worse during the pandemic, this feeds into the question about how to improve our sleep. One facet of it is that <strong>people used to have bigger barriers between the stressors of the day</strong>, work stressors, school stressors, and then home life. I've been listening to your podcast on the anthropology for world-building. And in your intro, you talk about <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St. Cuthbert</a> and how he went to his island, and he put his wall up so he didn't have to look at his day job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was thinking, &#8216;Cuthbert, dude, I am right there with you,' because as soon as I could get back into my physical office, I did. Because <strong>it's really hard to turn off the brain, to turn off the work brain when we are working from home</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here in Atlanta, a lot of people have really long commutes. And so they lost that. So while they might have been able to sleep a little bit more, they were having a harder time drawing that separation between work-life and home and sleep life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Absolutely. And we'll come back to how we can improve sleep. I just wanted to return to the different types of insomnia because in my family, there was always this story. My granddad, my mom's dad could fall asleep anywhere. And my mom would tell the story of he would go out to hang out the washing and he'd sort of hang himself over the washing line and he'd fall asleep there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: <strong>The family story is we can fall asleep anywhere. I absolutely was that person really until a couple of years ago</strong>. And I'm in that certain bracket of age where hormonal changes start to impact my sleep. So I do often wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. and I don't go back to sleep. And I've always been a morning person, but anything with a 3 in it can be a little bit annoying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yeah. That's early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: But then it's funny because I've started to tell the difference between that kind of waking up. And then <strong>when I wake up because of stress or anxiety or reasons where my mind&#8230;it's either my mind or it's my hormones</strong>. I have different reactions to that kind of sleeplessness. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is that a common thing for people to have these different reasons for insomnia at different times of their life?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. As you mentioned, especially for us women and I am right there with you in that bracket. And nobody ever talks about perimenopause, they always talk about menopause. So you think you're safe until you're 50, but you're really not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: No, you're 10 years behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes, exactly. It's one of the things that people think that they should be able to just go to sleep and sleep straight for seven to eight hours and never wake up. And the thing is that <strong>it is normal for adults to have awakenings during the night</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hope is that if you do have an awakening, okay, maybe you get up, you go pee, or you roll over, or you think for a couple of seconds or a few minutes, and then you fall back asleep. That's normal. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>If you are waking up for more than a half-hour total during the night, that is considered insomnia.</strong> </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And as for the different reasons, sure we can get into them a little bit during insomnia treatment, but we basically do very similar things regardless of why people are waking up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's interesting. Again, I do like a drink. I've been quite open about that on the podcast, but I have noticed that I used to really like a Pinot noir, and I've almost completely stopped drinking red wine now because I can feel the impact on my sleep, whereas I'm quite fine with Prosecco or Rose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh my gosh, me too. I have really cut back on my red wine drinking. And you see my last name, this is my last name. This is not my husband's last name. I feel like I should be able to drink those good Italian reds, but yes. More than two glasses, or sometimes even more than one glass and it comes back to get me later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: It's almost <strong>being much more self-aware around the things that make a difference</strong> in those. I tried valerian tea for a while. That did make a difference for a bit, and then it stopped working. So I gave up on that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there's a difference, like you said, about the acceptance. It's like, okay, this is just part of life. And I'm lucky in that I don't have any kind of day job so I can work. I often will just start work at 4:00 a.m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And then I just stop and by 4:00 p.m, I'm like, &#8216;Okay, pretty much it's all over, red rover.' I feel like the anxiety about not sleeping can often just build up and build up and then make it harder to sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do we get over that fear of not sleeping and maybe accept where we are at?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Definitely. That is honestly a lot of what we treat in my practice is anxiety over not sleeping. And <strong>that's really come to the forefront in the past year, not just with the pandemic where everybody's just more anxious and the anxiety is attaching to whatever it can</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also for the people who have had COVID and who have had these really rough weeks of sleep and it's being perpetuated by the fact that yes, that was such a rough week, it was a traumatic experience. And they're afraid that it's going to happen again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There is this big sleep myth that we must get eight hours</strong>. We see that number everywhere, eight hours of sleep. Whereas that's an average. The National Institute for Health here recommends that adults get between seven and nine hours with the very often not mentioned caveat that some people can sleep safely on average for an hour outside of those hills. So it's a bell curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adult sleep range may be even as wide as 6 to 10 hours. And another thing to consider is that we need different amounts of sleep on different nights. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have a range of sleep that you know your body likes. I know my body likes between seven and a half to nine hours of sleep a night. And if you think about it, that's a pretty big range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on nights when maybe I've been more active, I have to admit I have not once logged 10 hours a day for 4 days straight ever. But you probably slept great on those nights when you were walking all day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, I don't know. No, I didn't, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: You didn't?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: No. Again, I fall asleep very easily and I would fall asleep. And for people listening, that was the <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St Cuthbert's Way pilgrimage</a> I did recently. I fell asleep very quickly, but then, again, I would wake up at 3:00 a.m. So I'd find that almost the being physically tired doesn't actually necessarily help with that waking up insomnia. Although I don't like the phrase terminal insomnia, that sounds pretty serious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I know. That sounds like something that might come up in one of your books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Exactly. Yeah. Maybe that's giving me an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And we should say that seven hours to nine hours or whatever, that also includes these normal periods of waking for short amounts of time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does anyone really sleep without waking up after a certain age?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: It's very rare for adults. I have had patients who have said that they've gotten there or that before their insomnia developed a couple of years ago, that's what they were doing. But I suspect they were waking up briefly and did not remember it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, when somebody is sleeping seven, eight, nine hours straight, that's when they are in their childhood, teens, maybe early 20s, or late 20s. Generally once we get past 30, we are going to have small awakenings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Any other common sleep myths?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: The one that really irritates me is when should you go to bed every night at the same time. That is not the case because a lot of times <strong>if people are going to bed before they are truly sleepy, they're going to lie awake in bed</strong>, which then teaches your body and your brain that bed is for being awake, not for being asleep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a lot of people who perhaps their problems started because they heard that eight-hour number. They said, &#8216;Okay, I'm getting up at 6:00 in the morning for work. That means I need to be in bed by 10:00, even though my body isn't getting tired until 11:00 or 12:00.' And so they ended up getting themselves into trouble with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Some people really are night owls, aren't they? Their body wants to be awake in the dark. And it seems such an unacceptable way to live in the modern world, and yet it feels like there are a proportion of people who are that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Some people really are night owls, aren't they?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. That's another one of those things that really irritates me is that idea that the ideal sleep schedule is from 10:00 to 6:00. And there is there's even information out there that, oh, well, you're only going to get really good sleep in those hours before midnight. And that's really not the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We all have different circadian rhythms.</strong> It's one of my big soapboxes in sleep that <strong>we should be able to live and work according to our natural rhythms rather than being shoe-horned into whatever this ideal is</strong>. Honestly, that's one of the reasons why I am self-employed, so that I can set my own hours because I'm a little phase delayed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don't think I've ever gotten up regularly at 6:00 since I was in high school in the '90s and had to get up early because I had to have that perfect '90s hairstyle. That fell off quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I love that. You used &#8216;phase delayed'. I think that's brilliant because you're right, it's not necessarily a night owl, someone who wants to be awake when it's dark. It's that just even a couple of hours difference to even your potential, your partner, your kids. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are going to be difficult things in relationships is setting when that happens. I also find a lot of writers were into this because they can't necessarily work normal job hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I have found writing is a career you can do when you're phase delayed.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Exactly. It's perfect for us. And there's another one of those sleep myths versus <strong>writing myths is that the best writing time is first thing in the morning </strong>whereas for me, my brain just does not work like that. It works better for me to write after dinner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about this in the book <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em>, that <strong>I struggled for so long trying to fit into that (so-called) ideal mode</strong> of, &#8216;I must get up early. I must write for an hour before I go to work. I must do this, this, and this in order to be successful.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finally, I threw all those rules out the window</strong> and thought, &#8216;You know what? Let me just write when it works for me.' That is when I'm getting my NaNoWriMo words done this month is after dinner and it pushes my bedtime a little bit later, and that's okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: That's great you say that because, well, I'm one of those people who does write in the morning and sometimes really early, but now I think this is so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deanwesleysmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dean Wesley Smith</a>, who's been on the show and he's a virtual mentor for me. And he, I think, starts about 11:00 p.m. His writing phase is definitely over the night. And it's so interesting to hear that. Some people listening that it doesn't matter when it is. We're all different. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let's talk about how can we improve our sleep. The early bits or sleep rituals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do we improve with falling asleep?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: If you think about it, we are behavioral creatures. Even though we have evolved, we are still very behavioral creatures and <strong>our bodies and our minds like our routines</strong>. Admittedly, some people intellectually like routines a little bit better than others, but generally, we can train ourselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One big way to improve falling asleep is to <strong>give yourself adequate time and space to wind down</strong>. So think about those computers back in the '90s. You remember they took such a long time to shut down all of their various processes that we chose a song to play while they did that. Our brains are kind of like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving ourselves <strong>at least an hour of no screens</strong> because screens have that blue light that is activating to our brain and also a lot of the content on screens, even though we might tell ourselves it's relaxing, it can be activating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Especially in the pandemic, the doom scrolling. &#8216;Oh, just check it. Check it one more time.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh gosh, yes. I would have to say that's probably the biggest piece of advice that I've been giving since, oh, about say 2016 in this country, which is to really <strong>limit your news exposure</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I used to wake up in the morning and check the news and twitter. And that borders on addiction and I completely get it in my own behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read on a Kindle Paperwhite, which has an e-ink screen and I dial down the brightness all the way, and because it's only black and white&#8230;well, it's not white, it's kind of dark gray by the time that happens. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is using eInk screens like a Kindle or Kobo device okay?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. <strong>As long as you have dialed it back so that there is no glow at all</strong>, that's great. I got the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32PNRI4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kindle Oasis</a> for that reason because that is the one where you can dial it completely dark and you do need a light to read it. So you can see if perhaps the Paperwhite is still giving you enough light that it could disturb sleep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you say you have no trouble falling asleep, but it's interesting after having looked at tens of thousands of sleep diaries at this point, <strong>late-night light exposure can definitely impact sleep later on</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I also wear an eye mask, quite a thick <strong>eye mask and I also wear earplugs</strong>. My husband does maybe snore. And so I pretty much cut out all light in that way as well and sound. So I go into my little sensory deprivation tank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: My husband maybe snores too. I understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Does that help? Is that something you recommend for people, the eye mask, earplugs combination?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Only if they are really sensitive to light and noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I think I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Otherwise, we <strong>try to make sleep as simple as possible and so we try to not have too much extraneous things that need to happen in order for somebody to sleep</strong>, which is also another reason why we recommend that people not use sleep medication and <strong>we spend a lot of time getting people off-sleep medication</strong>. And that includes over-the-counter things like diphenhydramine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we were talking about before, melatonin, we can get that very easily here. I know you guys can't. But when you're taking something, you're giving yourself the signal that, &#8216;Hey, I can't sleep on my own.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I must say when I come to the U.S., it does shock me. I know lots of people who take something to go to sleep and then take something in the morning to kind of get them going or that kind of thing. And that medication, it must be very easy to get hooked on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have thought at times going to a doctor and getting something. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>But what I found is that getting rid of the anxiety around sleep has actually just helped a lot.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Your book is full of all the things so that you understand what's natural, as opposed to some sort of pop news tells you it's normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Right. And the pop news will just take the very simplest thing without the context and try to put that out there as a hard-and-fast rule. With a few exceptions, there really aren't any hard-and-fast rules that are going to work the same way for every single person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: There's one that says don't eat or drink X number of hours before bed. And then another one that says have some hot milk with honey or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about eating and/or drinking before bed?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: That's a great question because that's another one of those things that's super individual. <strong>You want to find this balance where you're not going to bed hungry, but you're also not going to bed stuffed.</strong> You want to be, shall we say, comfortably satisfied when you go to bed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, having hot milk helps with that. Maybe there's probably not enough tryptophan in there to make a real big difference, but it has some carbs and it has some protein, which keeps you from having those blood sugar spikes. So there's probably something to that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, for certain people, it works, and for other people, it doesn't. So for example, if somebody has reflux issues, they probably don't want to be drinking a glass of warm milk before bed because that's going to then disturb them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Any other things on improving sleep?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Since you talked about, or since you asked about food, exercise is another one of those things that there's a lot of conflicting information about. We hear you should not exercise close to bedtime, and that's another one of those really individual variables. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas some people, especially if they are a bit more anxious, tend to benefit from exercise closer to bedtime because it's helping to burn off some of that cortisol that's built up during the day from their anxiety. So for some people that works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise<strong> think about how exercise affects you</strong>. Some people exercise wakes them up. They're the ones who are at the gym at 5:00, 6:00 in the morning and they're great for the rest of the day. I wish I was one of those people. I'm one of those people where exercise wears me out. If I exercise first thing in the morning, like I did today, I am probably going to be a little tired for the rest of the day, but you know what, at least I got it over with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, that's interesting. I always exercise in the morning pretty much. After lunchtime, I'm not interested. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It's good to know that there are no rules. There's different categories and it's like each part of us fits into a different category. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We're all individuals, which is a relief, I suppose.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. I would say the only hard-and-fast rules for sleep if you want to know where to start with the basics are: <strong>try to wake up at around the same time every day</strong> because we have these circadian rhythms, these internal clocks that tell us when to be awake, when to be asleep, when to be hungry. If you want your body to know when it's supposed to be asleep, it needs to know when it's supposed to wake up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's why they say get up at the same time every single day. It's not just to torture you on weekends like a lot of people think. On the other hand, don't go to bed until you're sleepy. And then yes, cut out screens an hour before bedtime and have a routine. I would say those are the basics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are tons of other interfering things that happen that keep people from sleeping, which I talk about more of those in the book, but I want to say if you want just the core rules, those would be them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Again, simple, but it's not easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: But such is life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I'm very thankful that I sleep well because I will admit the getting up at the same time, I try to give myself an hour range and no more, although sometimes that can be difficult, especially after I've gone through a period where I'm now in introvert exhaustion. Like I mentioned, I was at a convention last weekend and we're recording this in early November, which means that we just had daylight savings time go off. And, oh my gosh, that extra hour of sleep on Sunday morning of convention was the best thing ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: You do have a section on mindfulness and meditation, but you do also acknowledge it's not for everyone because this is something that people say. My husband goes through phases when he will meditate every day and he finds it very useful, but it's not something I've found useful. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell us a bit about mindfulness if people want to try it or some of the alternatives.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I think you bring up a great question because there is a little bit of a distinction in that mindfulness is more of a way of approaching reality whereas meditation is a type of mindfulness activity. There are a lot of other different mindfulness activities that people can do if meditation just really isn't their thing. And that's fine. Sometimes it's not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had so many people tell me that they have failed at meditation where just to make a little distinction, a lot of times people think that the purpose of meditation is to clear your mind. Our minds don't do that, their job is to think, they're really good at it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is to <strong>get practiced at noticing when the mind is wandering and then bringing it back and noticing when it's wandering and bringing it back.</strong> By doing that over and over and over again during the practices, you then learn to better do that outside of the practices in times when it's more important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you wake up and your mind starts wandering in a not-so-useful direction, you're able to catch it more quickly before it gets as far as making you be up for hours. I do like to try to draw that distinction because there is so much misconception about mindfulness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm a regular meditator. I have found it to be very useful, but there are other aspects of mindfulness that I've found to be just as useful outside of that. For example, <strong>non-judgemental observation is a core mindfulness principle</strong>, and you've already talked about applying it, perhaps without realizing it, in that <strong>when you wake up, you don't get upset about being awake, you accept it. You approach that non-judgementally</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: That's made a big difference to me, actually. And, in fact, talking about our hormonal phase of life, I'm taking that attitude now a lot more about a lot of things and also having had COVID, and all the things I've been through this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maybe acceptance is just an attitude towards life in general.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Right. Exactly. I was thinking about this question and a lot of times people want to use mindfulness for stress reduction, which it's very useful, but if that's not really your philosophy or your thing, there are a couple of questions to ask that might be good alternatives that are still tangentially related. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, when you find yourself getting upset over something, one thing to ask that comes maybe more out of the cognitive therapy world is, &#8216;<strong>Where am I blowing up the drama?</strong>&#8216; Because as humans, we're wired for drama and our minds will automatically do that without us realizing it. That's why we like stories. Because they're full of drama. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tell ourselves stories that might be more full of drama than they need to be. Maybe we're filling in what other people are thinking without checking with them or without really knowing how often do we do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to approach it is, &#8216;Okay, <strong>is this thought useful or not useful?</strong>&#8216; And it sort of relates back to your interview with <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/09/06/strengths-for-writers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Becca Syme</a>, with question the premise. &#8216;Is this a useful premise for me to be operating from, or is this a useful thought for me to be engaging with and chewing on right now?'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Right now is the point, isn't it? It's like, &#8216;Okay, I've woken up and I'm thinking about this, this, this, and this. Maybe I could leave that till later rather than focusing on it.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now also, I do find <strong>breathing exercises</strong> useful because I'm someone I do hold my breath. When I think, when I do a lot of things, I hold my breath. It's on my list, learn breath work. But I have learned some basic breathing, like belly breathing and things like that to four-point breathing or whatever it's called and counting breaths. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I have found breathing exercises to be quite useful in some ways.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes, that's one thing I definitely do with all of my patients is we all start off with diaphragmatic breathing or as you call it, belly breathing, not only because it helps to calm the mind, but because breathing like that, breathing from your belly and keeping the chest still helps to turn on the parasympathetic or calming part of the autonomic nervous system, which then helps us to come out of fight or flight more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Fantastic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: The book has a lot about mindset and you talk about your author experiences in the examples, which I think is brilliant. It's very revealing. And I appreciate what you share in the book. Maybe you could share just a couple of things. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What have you learned from your indie author journey that informs your work as a psychologist?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Oh, that is a great question because typically people want to know how being a psychologist has helped me be a better writer. So that is a very creative way to ask the question. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say first, just being a writer has helped me to be a better psychotherapist because I'm a lot more creative. I believe, as a result, <strong>I'm able to look at things in perhaps different ways</strong> than what we were taught and then how. I'm able to explain things in different ways if people don't quite get the traditional wording and the traditional language. So that has definitely helped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly, as you know and as you read in the book, <strong>my indie author journey has had plenty of ups and downs</strong>. It's helped me be a better psychologist because it's helped me to accept for that there are going to be ups and downs, that there are going to be successes and failures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it's helped me to be a little, maybe not a lot, but a little bit <strong>more tolerant of uncertainty in my business</strong> and also know, &#8216;Okay, well, this thing didn't work. It doesn't mean I'm a failure. It just means I need to try something else.' I can bring that to my patients as well, which is, &#8216;Okay, you know what, so you tried this thing, didn't work. It's okay. Try something different.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I think that's really important. And do you enjoy the fact that you have this very different day job because sometimes there's this feeling in the community and I do try and dispel it, but I am a full-time creative entrepreneur. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Having a day job is also a really great thing because it means the entire pressure isn't on your creative work as such?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. I was so relieved to hear, I think, I can't remember if it was you or Mark who was reading that part in <em><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Relaxed Author</a></em>, which is if you have a day job that you like, or that works for you, it is perfectly okay to not want to be a full-time author. I had already felt that and I was like, &#8216;Yes, validation.'</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: And to be honest, it's actually may be easier and better because it separates what you said at the beginning about a problem between separating the barrier between home and work. This is something I just struggle with so much. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>If you can separate your life into these different areas, both of which fulfill you in a different way, that just seems magic.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I know you've talked about how hard you found it to write from home during the pandemic because you like to write at coffee shops, and I am the same way. I prefer to not write in the space where I see my clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That's another thing that I have found that's nice about writing in the evening because I put the day job to bed at 6:00 or 7:00. We're done. No more day job stuff. No more emails or looking at the calendar or anything like that, and at least I try to follow that rule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then after that, my mental shift is switching my home office to, &#8216;Okay, this is my writing space now.' I have my headphones and my music and the cat's always there regardless of which job it is. I have my wine. Obviously, I don't have that while I'm seeing patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Joanna Penn: Do you find that having the different names helps you switch your headspace?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes. Although it's funny since turning 40, my Cecilia Dominic persona, I would go to conventions. We're very fortunate to have a lot of local fantasy and pop culture conventions here in the Atlanta area. The biggest one is, of course, Dragon Con, but we have a bunch of smaller ones as well and across the Southeast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would go to conventions and I found for a while that <strong>Cecilia Dominic was a lot more outgoing, a lot more confident maybe,</strong> a lot more just&#8230;I'm trying to think of the right word. Maybe just like genuinely an author persona, whereas Anne Bartolucci is like more of a therapist persona, but <strong>since I've turned 40, the two have pretty much merged</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, that's interesting. You're on the show with both names but I am interviewing Anne, not Cecilia, but you're able to reconcile them both.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are you more comfortable sharing your professional side now?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Yes, now I'm much better able to reconcile the two of them. And I call the Cecilia Dominic persona the not-so-secret alter ego because if it's appropriate, of course, I will share that with my patients and here in my office where I see patients physically, although still only about a third of them coming in in-person, I have my ego shelf on the top of my bookshelf with all my books. So they see them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: That's great. And, of course, <strong>no judgment for anyone who doesn't want to share their alter egos and their writer names</strong>, but obviously, I did this myself and I find it useful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last question before we wind up, we're almost out of time, but so now, obviously, you're marketing non-fiction books and also your steampunk and urban fantasy under Cecilia. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What differences have you found between the writing and the book marketing processes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: So I don't know if this is the case for you, but for me, writing non-fiction is a lot harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Oh, it's the opposite for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: I thought you might say that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With non-fiction, when you get stuck, you can't just kill somebody off.</strong> The police don't like that. So I get non-fiction to be a lot harder. And a lot of the things I talk about in the books, in the book like perfectionism and procrastination and imposter syndrome, I experienced while I was writing that book because I was trying to be as genuine as possible and as honest and upfront about my struggles as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I had to recognize and resist that little voice that kept saying, &#8216;Oh, nobody really cares what you have to say.' </strong>When I'm writing as Cecilia, of course, it's fictional worlds, fictional characters, and I feel like maybe they're a little bit more separated for me. So I would say that would be the difference in the writing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as for marketing, <strong>I've definitely learned a lot about marketing from being an indie author</strong>, which has helped me with my non-fiction and even my practice. I would never have thought to run Facebook ads, for example, for my practice had I not done it first as an indie author.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still do mostly the paid ads for the fiction. I have a newsletter that I've had for a while. Talking to other authors, doing newsletter swaps and things like that, whereas for non-fiction, it's definitely been more of a strategy of let me get this book into the hands of people who can recommend it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I send copies to a bunch of my referral sources and that was one reason that I put it out in 2019 or in 2020, which was because I knew they needed resources for their patients. And so I was so busy at the practice, like, &#8216;Okay, I can't do a lot of publicity for this right now, but let me just get it out there so the people who need it can have it as a resource.' </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I'm also doing podcast interviews like this one. I did one for the &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.jeffreyshaw.com/podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Self-Employed Life</a>&#8216; a few weeks ago that just recently dropped. I ended up not being consistent about pitching other podcasts, but I'm going to get back to it. So yes, getting the non-fiction into the hands of experts and people who can recommend it is that strategy, whereas the fiction, it's more of, I guess, a wide wider strategy of getting it directly to consumers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I think that is interesting. And, of course, the book is <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em>. Although if you don't feel like an overachiever, it's still useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: I'm sure you called it that, but it's also if you feel like you're an underachiever, it's also useful. Brilliant. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where can people find you and your books online?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: You can find my Cecilia Dominic self at my website, ceciliadominic.com. And that is <a href=\"https://www.ceciliadominic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ceciliadominic.com</a> since there are two ways to spell Cecilia. Mine's one with an I. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in <em>Better Sleep for the Overachiever</em> with the blog that I update occasionally, that one is at <a href=\"http://overachieverbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">overachieverbook.com</a>. I was really excited when I got that website domain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if you're interested in me or my practice, if you're here in the States, of course, we can do telehealth with anybody in Georgia. And we're also SIPAC  providers, which means that we serve several other states as well. So you can find us, and I say us, not as the royal we, but since there are three of us, at <a href=\"https://www.sleepyintheatl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sleepyintheatl.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Penn: Fantastic. Thanks so much for your time, Anne. That was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne Bartolucci: Thank you, Joanna.

If I start off with lower expectations, perhaps it will turn out to be a spectacular year for us all (fingers crossed!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what I’m planning, and I’d love to hear about your goals, so please leave a comment here if you’d like to share and we can keep each other accountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Embrace multi-passionate creativity — and optimize for curiosity</li><li>Books for authors — Joanna Penn</li><li>Fiction as J.F. Penn — thrillers, dark fantasy, crime, horror, short stories</li><li>The Creative Penn website and podcast</li><li>The Creative Future — putting new technologies into practice</li><li>Books and Travel</li><li>More tech, less tech. Health, travel, and connection</li><li>Financial Goals&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, I am a full-time author-entrepreneur so I have a lot going on — if your goals are simpler — like finishing your book, or publishing for the first time, or selling 1000 copies, then fantastic! You don’t have to have such extensive goals as me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Embrace multi-passionate creativity — and optimize for curiosity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year, I think that I “might be more successful” if I can focus on a limited number of things, but as Walt Whitman said, “I am large, I contain multitudes.” As much as I try to say ‘no’ more, life proliferates and I find so many things interesting along the way that I want to do it all, or at least investigate things further.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/13/story-or-die/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lisa Cron pointed out in episode 592, “Emotion telegraphs meaning.”</a> If I am excited about a project or a topic, then I need to give it some time, even if the practical application (and the revenue) might not be obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m an author (across multiple genres). I’m a podcaster. I’m an audiobook narrator. I’m a course creator. I’m a speaker. I’m a futurist. These days, <strong>I optimize more for curiosity than for maintenance of the status quo</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30740\" width=\"322\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019.jpg 845w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019-279x300.jpg 279w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019-768x824.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" /><figcaption>Following my curiosity, J.F.

It can't just be &#8216;write, publish, repeat.' I cannot write to market, and I cannot write because I <em>have</em> to. I refuse to grind it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have <strong>so many things I want to create in 2022, and so many more things I want to learn about and share with you.</strong> I know I can’t do it all, so I will embrace my multi-passionate creativity, follow the paths my curiosity takes me down — and see where the year takes me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are my creative and business goals — some of them will happen, some won't, and I am far more accepting of that these days!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books for authors under Joanna Penn</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have three current works in progress, all with significant words in draft form:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How to Write a Novel — 95K</li><li>The Shadow Book (working title) — 30K</li><li>The AI-Assisted Author — 50K</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I’d love to say I’ll write and publish them all, each is a significant piece of work, and I have a lot of other things I want to do, so <strong>there will be at least one non-fiction book for authors— but I don’t know which as yet</strong>. There might also be a surprise book since that sometimes happens. I won’t second guess my Muse this early in the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/journals.jpg\" alt=\"writing journals\" class=\"wp-image-13588\" width=\"282\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/journals.jpg 350w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/journals-214x300.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" /><figcaption>Some of my many journals</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a LOT of words in draft — so I might also need to revisit <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3171Skd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Turning Pro</em> by </a>Steven Pressfield and consider what my Resistance is to finishing these projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of marketing for non-fiction, my main focus continues to be a weekly show on The Creative Penn Podcast, my <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blueprint</a> and email list, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter @thecreativepenn</a> (to a much lesser extent). I’ve been paying an <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/reedsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent freelancer through Reedsy</a> for managing my Amazon Ads for non-fiction, so I will continue to do that in 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books under J.F. Penn: Thrillers, dark fantasy, horror, crime — and travel!</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have quite a few books I want to write:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Travelogue / travel memoirs</strong> — <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/pilgrimage-canterbury/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Pilgrim’s Way</a> (currently at 30K draft) and also The <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St Cuthbert’s Way</a> (20K draft). It makes sense from a marketing point of view to put these out together, so hopefully, I will have both done this year. I’m also considering a Kickstarter for a special print run as I’d love to have some beautiful paper editions, and it’s something I am talking to <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/whitefox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">White Fox</a> about as they help with bespoke publishing projects (as we discussed in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/08/06/bringing-old-world-publishing-skills-to-new-world-creators/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">episode 566</a>).</li><li><strong>Short stories</strong> — I have so many ideas, so I need to get some of these out of my head. I’d like to do one short story a month. I’ll also record the audio versions myself, and I might even have enough for a collection by the end of 2022.</li><li><a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/arkane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ARKANE thriller</a> #13 — the story opens in Vienna, which I hope to visit in person depending on Covid restrictions</li><li>I have 13 more fiction projects sitting in Scrivener files — including several standalones that are half-formed ideas, so there might be something else, too.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"372\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Joanna-Penn-on-pilgrims-way.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32258\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Joanna-Penn-on-pilgrims-way.jpg 372w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Joanna-Penn-on-pilgrims-way-284x300.jpg 284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px\" /><figcaption>On the pilgrim's way — I still need to write this up!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m pretty sure I’ll publish the travel books under <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">J.F. Penn</a> rather than a new pen-name, like Jo Frances Penn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The benefit of a new name for a new genre</strong> is mainly around keeping readers separate, training the algorithms for targeting and easier auto-advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <strong>I don’t have the bandwidth for another active brand</strong> and I’m not willing to start any new social media profiles or email lists — and one of my goals is to bring new readers to my fiction — so I am erring on the side of sticking with J.F. Penn for the travel books at the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of marketing, I mainly use free or discounted first in series, scheduling promotions like Freebooksy, or BargainBooksy, or BookBub, or other ad pushes to attract readers to my ARKANE series. The <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/arkane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ARKANE series</a> has 12 books, and I have two trilogies — <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/brooke-and-daniel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brooke & Daniel psychological/crime thrillers</a>, and the <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/mapwalker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mapwalker fantasy trilogy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/arkane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12-ARKANE-thrillers-Dec-2021.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33847\" width=\"411\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12-ARKANE-thrillers-Dec-2021.png 542w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12-ARKANE-thrillers-Dec-2021-282x300.png 282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm also <strong>optimizing my backlist.</strong> I’m currently <strong>updating all the blurbs</strong> based on hiring <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/06/improve-your-fiction-book-description/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Michaelbrent Collings (as per episode 591</a>). I’m going to do another light edit on <em><a href=\"https://books2read.com/stoneoffire\" title=\"https://books2read.com/stoneoffire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stone of Fire</a></em> to tighten it up a little as that’s where I focus my marketing spend and it needs to draw people through into the other books. My writing has improved a lot over a decade, so even though part of me hates to revisit it, I want more people to continue in the series, so it’s worth a little time to re-edit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I am (mostly) wide and also write cross-genre, I haven’t found that Amazon Ads have worked well for my fiction in the past, so <strong>I am going to try again with Facebook Ads</strong>. Beginner's mind! I’m working through <a href=\"https://www.authoradsintensive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Skye Warren’s Author Ads Intensive</a>, and will also go through <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mark Dawson’s Ads for Authors course</a> again to revisit the principles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of maintenance, I need to redesign my <a href=\"http://JFPenn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JFPenn.com</a> website in 2022 and it generally needs some back-end technical love. Plus, I need to work through and update my email list automations. Not sexy — but <strong>all necessary business work</strong> that needs to be done!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Creative Penn Website and Podcast</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who completed the recent survey for the podcast. It helps me to know what you enjoy and find useful about the show. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We’ll hit episode 600 in the next month, and then it’s onward to 700</strong>, which I am committing to now the wave of change is accelerating. The indie author ride is about to get more exciting and I’m keen to keep surfing it and sharing the journey with you!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage.jpg\" alt=\"The Creative Penn Podcast\" class=\"wp-image-32793\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage.jpg 400w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked about the main topic split in the survey, and overall, it seemed that all are still relevant. Respondents could select multiple options and they were pretty close, with the order of preference being:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Book marketing</li><li>Writing craft &#8211; fiction&nbsp;</li><li>Self-publishing&nbsp;</li><li>Business of writing&nbsp;</li><li>Mindset&nbsp;</li><li>Futurist topics</li><li>Writing craft &#8211; non-fiction&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also received lots of ideas on what else to cover, but overall, it seems like the podcast is still serving you and the wider author community, so <strong>expect the podcast to continue with a mix of writing craft, publishing, marketing, author business, and futurist episodes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks so much to the corporate sponsors of the show and huge thanks also to my patrons at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">patreon.com/thecreativepenn</a> and also those who bought me coffee at <a href=\"http://BuyMeACoffee.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BuyMeACoffee.com/thecreativepenn</a>. Your contribution enables me time to think about the bigger topics and particularly to keep reporting on and delving into the futurist topics, which will benefit us all at some point! Talking of which…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/supportonpatreon-e1412764908776.jpg\" alt=\"supportonpatreon\" class=\"wp-image-20257\" width=\"285\" height=\"122\"/></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Creative Future — putting new technologies into practice&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, I talked about a lot of technological developments, and in 2022, I’ll put more of them into practice and integrate them into my creative process and my author business. It’s time to turn ideas into income!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many changes ahead, there are three that I consider practical for 2022: NFTs, AI narration, and AI writing tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I continue to be excited about the <strong>potential of blockchain applications for the Creator Economy</strong>. I intend to drop some kind of NFT book — and earn ETH, or another cryptocurrency. While I think <strong>there is definitely a bubble in some aspects of NFTs, it’s important to keep an eye on the underlying infrastructure shift rather than the ‘froth’ of media hype.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just about the jpeg, it’s about NFTs as unique digital assets, about tokens for membership and community, about resale of digital assets, and much more. Please don’t dismiss NFTs overall, just because you think $69m for Beeple art or $10K on digital trainers is ridiculous!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blockchain and NFTs are creating more potential revenue streams and business models for creatives</strong>, so I will keep an eye on that for you and share what I learn as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Future-of-creativity.jpg\" alt=\"Future of Creativity: AI, Web 3.0, Blockchain and more\" class=\"wp-image-33400\" width=\"383\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Future-of-creativity.jpg 640w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Future-of-creativity-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I also hope to work with DeepZen to <strong>build my AI narrator voice and use it to narrate one of my books</strong> — and maybe even make it available for licensing as another scalable income stream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will use Sudowrite (and/or other AI creative tools) within my fiction writing process, mainly as an extended thesaurus for multi-sensory description. I will continue to be an <a href=\"https://selfpublishingadvice.org/ai-for-authors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ethical author</a> and use an AI usage statement in the back of my fiction. I think transparency will become ever more important as ‘deep fakes’ and AI-generated content becomes more common. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also super curious about <strong>generative art</strong> — one of my favorite creators is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_thearchangel__/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Archangel</a>, who you’ll appreciate if you enjoy my fiction as J.F. Penn! Given that AI tools can now generate art from words, I’m planning to <strong>experiment with creating visual art from passages of my fiction</strong>. I want to do a special futurist episode on generative art, so if it’s something you’re into already, please contact me and mention this episode. I’ve found that writers become far more open to AI tools in other creative arenas than writing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to know more about futurist/ technological topics, check out the resources on <a href=\"http://TheCreativePenn.com/future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TheCreativePenn.com/future</a> and my online course, <a href=\"https://creative-penn-courses.teachable.com/p/the-ai-assisted-author\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The AI-Assisted Author</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30227\" width=\"266\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-150x150.png 150w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-300x300.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-768x768.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books and Travel&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love my <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel Podcast</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The podcast enables <strong>virtual escape without the hassle</strong>. Every time I interview someone, I’m transported to a different culture and the creative spark fuels my Muse and gives me ideas for where I’d like to go when the world (eventually) opens up again. Plus, I am writing some travel memoirs, so it will eventually serve a marketing purpose as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am seriously out of love with physical travel right now due to my experience with quarantine, isolation, repeated testing, and vaccine passport bureaucracy in New Zealand. And I need more time for writing and thinking and finishing all the projects I have in draft form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Books and Travel Podcast will go <strong>monthly</strong> from January, and I’ll add in extra ad hoc personal and solo shows as they emerge, and probably extra interviews as I find interesting people to talk to. I’ll also still blog and share photos from my travels and walks, which I intend to do more of in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>More tech, less tech. Health, travel, and connection</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the digital and online world becomes ever more important for my work and my social contacts as well as creative experimentation (more tech), I also want to focus on the physical world and human connection (less tech.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are not just brains — we are physical humans.</strong> We need movement and we need connection with others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while I want to immerse further in the digital stream, I also want to disconnect more, and be more embodied. I don’t think these two are mutually exclusive. Both can exist together. In fact, they have to. Because <strong>we need more tech as authors, and we need more offline time for life and love and everything else that matters</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/27/not-quite-the-year-we-hoped-for-review-of-my-2021-creative-business-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my 2021 round-up</a>, I’ve struggled with physical and mental health in the last year and the health gains I did manage in the first half of the year, broke down when I had Covid and with the disruption of international travel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32268\" width=\"406\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" /><figcaption>Walking the Pilgrims' Way, October 2020 — happily unplugged!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in 2022, I am <strong>recommitting to my intermittent fasting practice, my daily walks, and also my longer multi-day walks, as well as my twice-weekly weights workout</strong> with my personal trainer, Dan. I’ll also focus on sorting out my sleep — I have a whole ton of things to try, and I know that if I can sleep more effectively, a lot of other things will fall back into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to get my fitness back as I’ll be <strong>walking my Camino de Santiago </strong>in Q3 (if Covid restrictions allow) and I’m considering several routes at the moment. I also want to do the London Orbital, which is not a pilgrimage, but a walk I really fancy doing around a city that is endlessly fascinating — with no travel restrictions or testing requirements. We’d also really like a holiday somewhere in Europe but we’re not booking anything because of uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some <strong>in-person conferences</strong> on the horizon (again, if Covid restrictions allow!) — London Book Fair in April, the <a href=\"https://cex.events/\">Creator Economy Expo (CEX)</a> in Arizona in May, Thrillerfest in New York City in June, Mark Dawson’s SPF Live also in June, and 20BooksVegas in November. It’s unlikely that all those things will happen — but I’ve penciled them in.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JoannaPennOrnaRossLBF2018.jpg\" alt=\"Orna Ross with Joanna Penn LBF 2018\" class=\"wp-image-27942\" width=\"327\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JoannaPennOrnaRossLBF2018.jpg 720w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JoannaPennOrnaRossLBF2018-293x300.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" /><figcaption>Joanna Penn and Orna Ross at London Book Fair, 2018</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Given my experience with Covid, as well as New Zealand quarantine, testing, and vaccine passport difficulties based on international differences, I’ll only travel if restrictions are not too difficult in the destination country, state, and city. You might think it’s easy enough to get a vaccine pass in your own country, but try dealing with someone else’s bureaucracy!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Financial goals&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned in my 2021 round-up, my overall income dipped last year and I need to reverse the trend. If you want to increase <em>profit</em> in a business, there are two main levers you can use — cut costs or increase revenue — or do both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My business is already pretty lean on costs and, in fact, that is part of the problem. Most successful authors now spend more than I do on advertising and marketing — so once again, it’s<strong> back to the fundamentals with ads</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will never be a super-fast writer publishing a book a month, but <strong>I now have a decent backlist for fiction and non-fiction</strong>, so if I bring more readers into those eco-systems (without spending TOO much), then it should result in financial growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I’ve spent less <em>within</em> the business, <strong>I have invested a lot more than usual over the pandemic </strong>and that continues to be a focus. <strong>My next financial goal is to make more from my investments than my ‘work’</strong> — but that is a multi-year plan with a lot of facets. Clearly, this is not a financial or investment-focused site, but I do have a list of <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/moneybooks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recommended money books</a> if you want to take this further yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once again, like most author entrepreneurs, the plan is to <strong>write more books — fiction and non-fiction, optimize my backlist, refocus on ads, and continue with my investment plans</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for being part of my community in the last year</strong> — for buying my books in all formats, for being a patron of the show, for clicking my affiliate links, for leaving positive reviews on the books and the podcast, and for recommending them to others. I wouldn’t have this career without you, so thank you so much and I hope you’ll join me for the year ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Happy-new-year-from-Auckland-Dec-2021.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33848\" width=\"370\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Happy-new-year-from-Auckland-Dec-2021.png 750w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Happy-new-year-from-Auckland-Dec-2021-300x291.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" /><figcaption>Happy New year from auckland, new zealand!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Onwards into 2022, creatives!

I’m a podcaster. I’m an audiobook narrator. I’m a course creator. I’m a speaker. I’m a futurist. These days, <strong>I optimize more for curiosity than for maintenance of the status quo</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30740\" width=\"322\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019.jpg 845w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019-279x300.jpg 279w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Joanna-Penn-Thinking-Book-Research-Lisbon-2019-768x824.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" /><figcaption>Following my curiosity, J.F.

It can't just be &#8216;write, publish, repeat.' I cannot write to market, and I cannot write because I <em>have</em> to. I refuse to grind it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have <strong>so many things I want to create in 2022, and so many more things I want to learn about and share with you.</strong> I know I can’t do it all, so I will embrace my multi-passionate creativity, follow the paths my curiosity takes me down — and see where the year takes me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are my creative and business goals — some of them will happen, some won't, and I am far more accepting of that these days!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books for authors under Joanna Penn</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have three current works in progress, all with significant words in draft form:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How to Write a Novel — 95K</li><li>The Shadow Book (working title) — 30K</li><li>The AI-Assisted Author — 50K</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I’d love to say I’ll write and publish them all, each is a significant piece of work, and I have a lot of other things I want to do, so <strong>there will be at least one non-fiction book for authors— but I don’t know which as yet</strong>. There might also be a surprise book since that sometimes happens. I won’t second guess my Muse this early in the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/journals.jpg\" alt=\"writing journals\" class=\"wp-image-13588\" width=\"282\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/journals.jpg 350w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/journals-214x300.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" /><figcaption>Some of my many journals</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a LOT of words in draft — so I might also need to revisit <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3171Skd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Turning Pro</em> by </a>Steven Pressfield and consider what my Resistance is to finishing these projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of marketing for non-fiction, my main focus continues to be a weekly show on The Creative Penn Podcast, my <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/blueprint/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blueprint</a> and email list, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter @thecreativepenn</a> (to a much lesser extent). I’ve been paying an <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/reedsy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">excellent freelancer through Reedsy</a> for managing my Amazon Ads for non-fiction, so I will continue to do that in 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books under J.F. Penn: Thrillers, dark fantasy, horror, crime — and travel!</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I have quite a few books I want to write:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Travelogue / travel memoirs</strong> — <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/pilgrimage-canterbury/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Pilgrim’s Way</a> (currently at 30K draft) and also The <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St Cuthbert’s Way</a> (20K draft). It makes sense from a marketing point of view to put these out together, so hopefully, I will have both done this year. I’m also considering a Kickstarter for a special print run as I’d love to have some beautiful paper editions, and it’s something I am talking to <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/whitefox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">White Fox</a> about as they help with bespoke publishing projects (as we discussed in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/08/06/bringing-old-world-publishing-skills-to-new-world-creators/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">episode 566</a>).</li><li><strong>Short stories</strong> — I have so many ideas, so I need to get some of these out of my head.

Penn</a> rather than a new pen-name, like Jo Frances Penn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The benefit of a new name for a new genre</strong> is mainly around keeping readers separate, training the algorithms for targeting and easier auto-advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <strong>I don’t have the bandwidth for another active brand</strong> and I’m not willing to start any new social media profiles or email lists — and one of my goals is to bring new readers to my fiction — so I am erring on the side of sticking with J.F. Penn for the travel books at the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of marketing, I mainly use free or discounted first in series, scheduling promotions like Freebooksy, or BargainBooksy, or BookBub, or other ad pushes to attract readers to my ARKANE series. The <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/arkane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ARKANE series</a> has 12 books, and I have two trilogies — <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/brooke-and-daniel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brooke & Daniel psychological/crime thrillers</a>, and the <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/mapwalker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mapwalker fantasy trilogy</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book-tag/arkane/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12-ARKANE-thrillers-Dec-2021.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33847\" width=\"411\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12-ARKANE-thrillers-Dec-2021.png 542w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12-ARKANE-thrillers-Dec-2021-282x300.png 282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm also <strong>optimizing my backlist.</strong> I’m currently <strong>updating all the blurbs</strong> based on hiring <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/06/improve-your-fiction-book-description/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Michaelbrent Collings (as per episode 591</a>). I’m going to do another light edit on <em><a href=\"https://books2read.com/stoneoffire\" title=\"https://books2read.com/stoneoffire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stone of Fire</a></em> to tighten it up a little as that’s where I focus my marketing spend and it needs to draw people through into the other books. My writing has improved a lot over a decade, so even though part of me hates to revisit it, I want more people to continue in the series, so it’s worth a little time to re-edit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I am (mostly) wide and also write cross-genre, I haven’t found that Amazon Ads have worked well for my fiction in the past, so <strong>I am going to try again with Facebook Ads</strong>. Beginner's mind! I’m working through <a href=\"https://www.authoradsintensive.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Skye Warren’s Author Ads Intensive</a>, and will also go through <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mark Dawson’s Ads for Authors course</a> again to revisit the principles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of maintenance, I need to redesign my <a href=\"http://JFPenn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JFPenn.com</a> website in 2022 and it generally needs some back-end technical love. Plus, I need to work through and update my email list automations. Not sexy — but <strong>all necessary business work</strong> that needs to be done!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Creative Penn Website and Podcast</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who completed the recent survey for the podcast. It helps me to know what you enjoy and find useful about the show. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We’ll hit episode 600 in the next month, and then it’s onward to 700</strong>, which I am committing to now the wave of change is accelerating.

It’s time to turn ideas into income!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are many changes ahead, there are three that I consider practical for 2022: NFTs, AI narration, and AI writing tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I continue to be excited about the <strong>potential of blockchain applications for the Creator Economy</strong>. I intend to drop some kind of NFT book — and earn ETH, or another cryptocurrency. While I think <strong>there is definitely a bubble in some aspects of NFTs, it’s important to keep an eye on the underlying infrastructure shift rather than the ‘froth’ of media hype.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just about the jpeg, it’s about NFTs as unique digital assets, about tokens for membership and community, about resale of digital assets, and much more. Please don’t dismiss NFTs overall, just because you think $69m for Beeple art or $10K on digital trainers is ridiculous!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blockchain and NFTs are creating more potential revenue streams and business models for creatives</strong>, so I will keep an eye on that for you and share what I learn as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Future-of-creativity.jpg\" alt=\"Future of Creativity: AI, Web 3.0, Blockchain and more\" class=\"wp-image-33400\" width=\"383\" height=\"215\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Future-of-creativity.jpg 640w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Future-of-creativity-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I also hope to work with DeepZen to <strong>build my AI narrator voice and use it to narrate one of my books</strong> — and maybe even make it available for licensing as another scalable income stream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will use Sudowrite (and/or other AI creative tools) within my fiction writing process, mainly as an extended thesaurus for multi-sensory description. I will continue to be an <a href=\"https://selfpublishingadvice.org/ai-for-authors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ethical author</a> and use an AI usage statement in the back of my fiction. I think transparency will become ever more important as ‘deep fakes’ and AI-generated content becomes more common. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also super curious about <strong>generative art</strong> — one of my favorite creators is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/_thearchangel__/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Archangel</a>, who you’ll appreciate if you enjoy my fiction as J.F. Penn! Given that AI tools can now generate art from words, I’m planning to <strong>experiment with creating visual art from passages of my fiction</strong>. I want to do a special futurist episode on generative art, so if it’s something you’re into already, please contact me and mention this episode. I’ve found that writers become far more open to AI tools in other creative arenas than writing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to know more about futurist/ technological topics, check out the resources on <a href=\"http://TheCreativePenn.com/future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TheCreativePenn.com/future</a> and my online course, <a href=\"https://creative-penn-courses.teachable.com/p/the-ai-assisted-author\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The AI-Assisted Author</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-30227\" width=\"266\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-150x150.png 150w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-300x300.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave-768x768.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BooksTravelPodcastWave.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books and Travel&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love my <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel Podcast</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The podcast enables <strong>virtual escape without the hassle</strong>. Every time I interview someone, I’m transported to a different culture and the creative spark fuels my Muse and gives me ideas for where I’d like to go when the world (eventually) opens up again. Plus, I am writing some travel memoirs, so it will eventually serve a marketing purpose as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am seriously out of love with physical travel right now due to my experience with quarantine, isolation, repeated testing, and vaccine passport bureaucracy in New Zealand. And I need more time for writing and thinking and finishing all the projects I have in draft form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Books and Travel Podcast will go <strong>monthly</strong> from January, and I’ll add in extra ad hoc personal and solo shows as they emerge, and probably extra interviews as I find interesting people to talk to. I’ll also still blog and share photos from my travels and walks, which I intend to do more of in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>More tech, less tech. Health, travel, and connection</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the digital and online world becomes ever more important for my work and my social contacts as well as creative experimentation (more tech), I also want to focus on the physical world and human connection (less tech.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are not just brains — we are physical humans.</strong> We need movement and we need connection with others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while I want to immerse further in the digital stream, I also want to disconnect more, and be more embodied. I don’t think these two are mutually exclusive. Both can exist together. In fact, they have to. Because <strong>we need more tech as authors, and we need more offline time for life and love and everything else that matters</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/27/not-quite-the-year-we-hoped-for-review-of-my-2021-creative-business-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my 2021 round-up</a>, I’ve struggled with physical and mental health in the last year and the health gains I did manage in the first half of the year, broke down when I had Covid and with the disruption of international travel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32268\" width=\"406\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/JFPenn-walking-in-London.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px\" /><figcaption>Walking the Pilgrims' Way, October 2020 — happily unplugged!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in 2022, I am <strong>recommitting to my intermittent fasting practice, my daily walks, and also my longer multi-day walks, as well as my twice-weekly weights workout</strong> with my personal trainer, Dan. I’ll also focus on sorting out my sleep — I have a whole ton of things to try, and I know that if I can sleep more effectively, a lot of other things will fall back into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to get my fitness back as I’ll be <strong>walking my Camino de Santiago </strong>in Q3 (if Covid restrictions allow) and I’m considering several routes at the moment. I also want to do the London Orbital, which is not a pilgrimage, but a walk I really fancy doing around a city that is endlessly fascinating — with no travel restrictions or testing requirements. We’d also really like a holiday somewhere in Europe but we’re not booking anything because of uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some <strong>in-person conferences</strong> on the horizon (again, if Covid restrictions allow!) — London Book Fair in April, the <a href=\"https://cex.events/\">Creator Economy Expo (CEX)</a> in Arizona in May, Thrillerfest in New York City in June, Mark Dawson’s SPF Live also in June, and 20BooksVegas in November. It’s unlikely that all those things will happen — but I’ve penciled them in.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JoannaPennOrnaRossLBF2018.jpg\" alt=\"Orna Ross with Joanna Penn LBF 2018\" class=\"wp-image-27942\" width=\"327\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JoannaPennOrnaRossLBF2018.jpg 720w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JoannaPennOrnaRossLBF2018-293x300.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px\" /><figcaption>Joanna Penn and Orna Ross at London Book Fair, 2018</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Given my experience with Covid, as well as New Zealand quarantine, testing, and vaccine passport difficulties based on international differences, I’ll only travel if restrictions are not too difficult in the destination country, state, and city. You might think it’s easy enough to get a vaccine pass in your own country, but try dealing with someone else’s bureaucracy!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Financial goals&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned in my 2021 round-up, my overall income dipped last year and I need to reverse the trend. If you want to increase <em>profit</em> in a business, there are two main levers you can use — cut costs or increase revenue — or do both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My business is already pretty lean on costs and, in fact, that is part of the problem. Most successful authors now spend more than I do on advertising and marketing — so once again, it’s<strong> back to the fundamentals with ads</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will never be a super-fast writer publishing a book a month, but <strong>I now have a decent backlist for fiction and non-fiction</strong>, so if I bring more readers into those eco-systems (without spending TOO much), then it should result in financial growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I’ve spent less <em>within</em> the business, <strong>I have invested a lot more than usual over the pandemic </strong>and that continues to be a focus. <strong>My next financial goal is to make more from my investments than my ‘work’</strong> — but that is a multi-year plan with a lot of facets. Clearly, this is not a financial or investment-focused site, but I do have a list of <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/moneybooks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recommended money books</a> if you want to take this further yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once again, like most author entrepreneurs, the plan is to <strong>write more books — fiction and non-fiction, optimize my backlist, refocus on ads, and continue with my investment plans</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for being part of my community in the last year</strong> — for buying my books in all formats, for being a patron of the show, for clicking my affiliate links, for leaving positive reviews on the books and the podcast, and for recommending them to others. I wouldn’t have this career without you, so thank you so much and I hope you’ll join me for the year ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Happy-new-year-from-Auckland-Dec-2021.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33848\" width=\"370\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Happy-new-year-from-Auckland-Dec-2021.png 750w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Happy-new-year-from-Auckland-Dec-2021-300x291.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" /><figcaption>Happy New year from auckland, new zealand!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Onwards into 2022, creatives!

It can't just be &#8216;write, publish, repeat.' I cannot write to market, and I cannot write because I have to. I refuse to grind it out. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI have so many things I want to create in 2022, and so many more things I want to learn about and share with you.

I’ll be back soon with my plans and goals for 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever the optimist, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/01/01/2021-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I wrote on 1 Jan, 2021</a>: “I’m expecting it to be at least a full pandemic year — from March 2020 to March 2021, but I am really hoping to be back in the world in the second half of this year.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also intended 2021 “to be a year of expansion&nbsp;— creatively in terms of what I write, mentally in terms of the things I learn about, and physically, in terms of my health and where I travel (once we're out of the woods with the virus, of course.)”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Well, this year did not turn out as we all hoped, did it?!</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of me doesn’t want to do this round-up because I don’t really want to relive most of the year. But <strong>I’ve always found it incredibly useful to be accountable to you as my audience</strong>, and by looking back, we can be thankful to have made it through — and if you’re reading/listening to this, you have made it through —&nbsp;and hopefully, gain some perspective on what might be possible in the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will talk about some of the creative goals I achieved — and missed — but I want to start with something far more important.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>If you’re utterly exhausted and struggling with physical and mental health issues, you’re not alone.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve talked about my various issues on the podcast over the year but essentially, it’s been one of my worst years ever in terms of mental and physical health. I share these things not for sympathy, but in the hope that it helps you if you have felt or are still feeling the same way, because we are certainly not alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK winter lockdown (6 Jan &#8211; mid-March 2021) was brutal. I always have some form of SAD (seasonal affective disorder) but it was compounded by sleep issues, resulting from a combination of age-related hormonal changes and pandemic anxiety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jfpennauthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33840\" width=\"587\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath.png 776w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath-300x114.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath-768x291.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep issues have been reported across the world during the pandemic (<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2021/06/news-concerns-sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">APA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00196-6/fulltext#:~:text=Sleep%20problems%20appear%20to%20have,psychological%20distress%20may%20be%20reduced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Lancet</a>), but that doesn’t make it easier for any of us experiencing lack of it. That hasn’t resolved, but my anxiety about not sleeping has lessened, and in fact, I have a sleep psychologist on the show in early January since I have a feeling many of you are struggling with it, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Another common pandemic issue is feeling constantly tired, on the edge of fatigue, and almost burned-out from the bad news, uncertainty, and anxiety. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t really have this in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2020/12/31/2020-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2020</a>. Yes, the fear was real, but I was able to rally all my energy and go hard in making sure my business would survive. In 2020, I wrote a lot of books, did a lot of marketing, worked super hard — and all that probably contributed to feeling even more tired in 2021! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That kind of energy is unsustainable and <strong>as the pandemic grinds on, it grinds us all down</strong>. We might feel a flurry of hope at some good news, and then it sinks away again as the next wave hits and we can’t help but doomscroll, looking for just that tiny bit of news that might change things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I contracted the Delta variant in mid-July 2021 along with a ton of other people in the UK. (Yes, I was double-vaxxed. No health or political comments, please!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t experience breathing issues and didn’t need hospitalization, so I am grateful for the vaccine — but it was still a very difficult few weeks of sickness (the sickest I have ever been) followed by around two and a half months of recovery. I still don’t have my sense of smell back entirely, and I have more difficulty getting my breath on hills that used to be easy. But given that my cousin was in a coma on a ventilator in the first wave, again, I am very grateful for the vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The physical symptoms of Covid also came with a surprising amount of mental health issues</strong> — depression, anxiety, fear of ever getting better, inability to concentrate, weeping — and I’m not sure that has entirely receded. I read Kris Rusch’s book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HgRJR9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Writing with Chronic Illness</a>, while I was sick, and I listened to a LOT of audiobooks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did walk the <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St Cuthbert’s Way</a> in October 2021, more on that later, to prove to myself I was physically better and that helped a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covid also broke my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/07/05/intermittent-fasting-gin-stephens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">intermittent fasting</a> regime as I could only taste texture and salt, so I lived on sourdough toast, butter and Bovril for several weeks, and then my energy was so low, and I use food for emotional support —&nbsp;so it all fell apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in late November, we experienced the stress of international travel to Aotearoa New Zealand to visit my mother-in-law who has advanced cancer. I’m writing and recording this from Auckland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NZ has (mostly) kept Covid out, as they have one of the strictest border control, quarantine, and isolation regimes in the world. It took months to get a slot in MIQ and then began a bureaucratic nightmare, paperwork, vaccine passports — and what I struggled with the most — seven days of quarantine in a room with no opening window, 23.5 hours a day inside that room with only 30 minutes walking slowly clockwise around a carpark, guarded by the military; tested by people in hazmat gear; and generally treated like a virus-vector rather than a human. Even when we made it out, it took several weeks of chasing bureaucracy to get a vaccine passport because we were vaxxed in the UK, which made us second-class citizens for a while.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a result of all this, I am <em>seriously</em> out of love with travel</strong> — which is something I didn’t think I would ever say. More on that to come as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have also learned a lot about <strong>acceptance in terms of a limited physical and mental capacity.</strong> My upbringing was very much ‘power of positive thinking’ and a Protestant work ethic and sickness was almost a moral weakness. Take some vitamin C tablets and soldier on. But that has been impossible for much of the year — and I raged against it — but then I had to just let it be, and go back to bed and rest. Memento mori indeed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this to say that this has been one of the most difficult years of my life — and I know my life is not as challenging as many others — so if you feel any of this, then you are not alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite all this, I did manage to do a few things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"http://thecreativepenn.com/makealiving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-1024x536.png\" alt=\"How To Make A Living with your writing 3\" class=\"wp-image-32484\" width=\"367\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-1024x536.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-300x157.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-768x402.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Joanna Penn — Books for authors</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my goals was to write <a href=\"http://thecreativepenn.com/makealiving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Make a Living with your Writing Third Edition</a> — which I did in the first quarter and narrated the audiobook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also intended to finish <em>How to Write a Novel,</em> but once again, I opened the Scrivener file several times and just couldn’t get on with it. I have some imposter syndrome around the topic, for sure. After all, Stephen King wrote a book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mBpTrc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">On Writing! </a>It’s also such a dauntingly large subject so I need to pick an angle, but it remains on the To Write list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-1024x275.png\" alt=\"The Relaxed Author\" class=\"wp-image-33539\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-1024x275.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-300x81.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-768x206.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage.png 1146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The surprise book of the year was <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Relaxed Author,</a> which I co-wrote with Mark Leslie Lefebvre — and we both did the audiobook narration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sprang out of an interview conversation and then we had so many comments saying it was needed, that we went ahead and wrote the book. We both had to clear our schedules to write it, but I’m glad we did. <strong>Lots of you have said it’s been useful in a year when we all needed to relax more.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, I finished it just before getting Covid and you can listen to us talking about our process and what we learned about each other in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/09/27/co-writing-the-relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">episode 575</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In foreign rights, I self-published <a href=\"http://mybook.to/BusinessPlanDE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Your Author Business Plan in German </a>and also licensed some more non-fiction <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3swosOt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">books for authors in French</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I intended to double down on selling direct which I have definitely achieved. There’s more I could do, but I sell ebooks and audiobooks every day from <a href=\"http://payhip.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payhip.com/thecreativepenn</a>. You get a good deal, and I get money in my bank account immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know many of you have used <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/selldirecttutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my tutorial on selling direct</a> to set up your own direct sales, so I’m pleased that’s becoming more of a trend for indies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Creative Penn Website</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2021, Google updated their algorithm around page speed and some other metrics, so I implemented a new theme and some technical backend things on TheCreativePenn.com, one of those tasks that you just have to do sporadically with what is now a 13-year-old site!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should now find it easier to search if you use the <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Search Bar on the Start Here page</a> and there are more landing pages and resource pages for the most common things: <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/editors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">editors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/bookcoverdesign/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">book cover design</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tools for authors</a>, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run an author business, <strong>your website and email list are assets,</strong> just as much as your books. I frequently get offers for this site but of course, it’s not for sale. It is the hub for everything I do online, and it drives significant revenue — and importantly, I control it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to maintain our backlist books, but we also have to maintain our backlist website/s. So this was a business-critical task that just had to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage.jpg\" alt=\"The Creative Penn Podcast\" class=\"wp-image-32793\" width=\"229\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage.jpg 400w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Creative Penn Podcast</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been an epic year for The Creative Penn Podcast with weekly episodes as usual, plus a lot of extra in-between-isodes and futurist shows (69 episodes in 2021 in total).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to my corporate sponsors and to my patrons at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">patreon.com/thecreativepenn</a> for continuing to support the show.

I also published the <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/mapwalkertrilogy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mapwalker Trilogy</a> in all the formats, and <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/tree-of-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tree of Life</a> in audiobook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pulled the first three ARKANE thrillers out of ACX exclusivity and took them wide. Plus, I engaged Michaelbrent Collings to help with <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/06/improve-your-fiction-book-description/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my fiction book descriptions after his fantastic interview on the topic in episode 591</a>. I’m in the middle of updating all of that through the publishing eco-system. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books and Travel</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel Podcast</a> is now at 76 episodes and this year, I found solace in virtual escape and dreams of travel that the interviews provided me — and from the comments and emails, my listeners found that too. It is a podcast of love and still doesn’t bring me any direct income, because I haven’t written the travel books I intended to, but it has brought me happiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also using the site as a blog to share articles and pictures from places I travel, so you can read and see the <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pictures from the St Cuthbert’s Way,</a> even though I haven’t done a solo episode on it, or written the book yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like some virtual travel, or some musings on the deeper side of it all, just search for Books and Travel Podcast on your favourite app, or check out the backlist at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BooksAndTravel.page/listen</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jfpennauthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"174\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-1024x174.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33839\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-1024x174.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-300x51.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-768x131.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021.png 1382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Health, travel, walking&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In my 2021 goals, I said, “I’m expecting it to be at least a full pandemic year — from March 2020 to March 2021, but I am really hoping to be back in the world in the second half of this year. I'm planning trips to Portugal and Japan, as well as some more ultra-marathons and another walking pilgrimage in the north of England.&nbsp;My plan is to work hard in the earlier months so I can have more time off later in the year for some much-needed travel, family catch-ups, and book research trips.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hmm, well, once again, not really as expected</strong> — but we made the most of our beautiful country and I appreciate the UK as a holiday destination more than ever! We did the following:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/cycling-oxford-to-bath-cotswolds/\">Cycled from Oxford to Bath through the Cotswolds</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/south-west-coast-path-lyme-regis-to-seaton/\">Walked along the Jurassic Coast</a> and visited the gorgeous coastal town of Lyme Regis</li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CT45px3AkqY/\">Walked in Puzzle Wood</a>, part of the ancient Forest of Dean that inspired Tolkien’s Fangorn&nbsp;</li><li>I <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\">walked the St Cuthbert’s Way</a> from the borders of Scotland across Northumberland to Lindisfarne, Holy Island</li><li>After an incredible amount of stress — and a double dose of bureaucratic hell and quarantine difficulties — we made it to Auckland, New Zealand. It’s a family trip and not a holiday, since my mother-in-law is immune-compromised, so we can’t do much, but it is warm and there is sea and bush to walk beside.

I spent a lot of time on things that don’t bring in immediate revenue, but should add revenue streams in the future. I also said ‘no’ to many opportunities for income for mental health reasons, and just because it wasn’t interesting to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I want to continue with the experimentation in 2022, I do want to try and lift my income again, so more on that in my 2022 goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"979\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33843\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass.png 979w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass-300x93.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass-768x238.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\" /><figcaption>This too shall pass.

But <strong>I’ve always found it incredibly useful to be accountable to you as my audience</strong>, and by looking back, we can be thankful to have made it through — and if you’re reading/listening to this, you have made it through —&nbsp;and hopefully, gain some perspective on what might be possible in the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will talk about some of the creative goals I achieved — and missed — but I want to start with something far more important.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>If you’re utterly exhausted and struggling with physical and mental health issues, you’re not alone.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve talked about my various issues on the podcast over the year but essentially, it’s been one of my worst years ever in terms of mental and physical health. I share these things not for sympathy, but in the hope that it helps you if you have felt or are still feeling the same way, because we are certainly not alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK winter lockdown (6 Jan &#8211; mid-March 2021) was brutal. I always have some form of SAD (seasonal affective disorder) but it was compounded by sleep issues, resulting from a combination of age-related hormonal changes and pandemic anxiety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jfpennauthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33840\" width=\"587\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath.png 776w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath-300x114.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Winter-lockdown-in-Bath-768x291.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep issues have been reported across the world during the pandemic (<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2021/06/news-concerns-sleep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">APA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00196-6/fulltext#:~:text=Sleep%20problems%20appear%20to%20have,psychological%20distress%20may%20be%20reduced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Lancet</a>), but that doesn’t make it easier for any of us experiencing lack of it. That hasn’t resolved, but my anxiety about not sleeping has lessened, and in fact, I have a sleep psychologist on the show in early January since I have a feeling many of you are struggling with it, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Another common pandemic issue is feeling constantly tired, on the edge of fatigue, and almost burned-out from the bad news, uncertainty, and anxiety. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t really have this in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2020/12/31/2020-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2020</a>. Yes, the fear was real, but I was able to rally all my energy and go hard in making sure my business would survive. In 2020, I wrote a lot of books, did a lot of marketing, worked super hard — and all that probably contributed to feeling even more tired in 2021! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That kind of energy is unsustainable and <strong>as the pandemic grinds on, it grinds us all down</strong>. We might feel a flurry of hope at some good news, and then it sinks away again as the next wave hits and we can’t help but doomscroll, looking for just that tiny bit of news that might change things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I contracted the Delta variant in mid-July 2021 along with a ton of other people in the UK. (Yes, I was double-vaxxed. No health or political comments, please!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t experience breathing issues and didn’t need hospitalization, so I am grateful for the vaccine — but it was still a very difficult few weeks of sickness (the sickest I have ever been) followed by around two and a half months of recovery. I still don’t have my sense of smell back entirely, and I have more difficulty getting my breath on hills that used to be easy. But given that my cousin was in a coma on a ventilator in the first wave, again, I am very grateful for the vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The physical symptoms of Covid also came with a surprising amount of mental health issues</strong> — depression, anxiety, fear of ever getting better, inability to concentrate, weeping — and I’m not sure that has entirely receded. I read Kris Rusch’s book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3HgRJR9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Writing with Chronic Illness</a>, while I was sick, and I listened to a LOT of audiobooks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did walk the <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">St Cuthbert’s Way</a> in October 2021, more on that later, to prove to myself I was physically better and that helped a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covid also broke my <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/07/05/intermittent-fasting-gin-stephens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">intermittent fasting</a> regime as I could only taste texture and salt, so I lived on sourdough toast, butter and Bovril for several weeks, and then my energy was so low, and I use food for emotional support —&nbsp;so it all fell apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in late November, we experienced the stress of international travel to Aotearoa New Zealand to visit my mother-in-law who has advanced cancer. I’m writing and recording this from Auckland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NZ has (mostly) kept Covid out, as they have one of the strictest border control, quarantine, and isolation regimes in the world. It took months to get a slot in MIQ and then began a bureaucratic nightmare, paperwork, vaccine passports — and what I struggled with the most — seven days of quarantine in a room with no opening window, 23.5 hours a day inside that room with only 30 minutes walking slowly clockwise around a carpark, guarded by the military; tested by people in hazmat gear; and generally treated like a virus-vector rather than a human. Even when we made it out, it took several weeks of chasing bureaucracy to get a vaccine passport because we were vaxxed in the UK, which made us second-class citizens for a while.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a result of all this, I am <em>seriously</em> out of love with travel</strong> — which is something I didn’t think I would ever say. More on that to come as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have also learned a lot about <strong>acceptance in terms of a limited physical and mental capacity.</strong> My upbringing was very much ‘power of positive thinking’ and a Protestant work ethic and sickness was almost a moral weakness. Take some vitamin C tablets and soldier on. But that has been impossible for much of the year — and I raged against it — but then I had to just let it be, and go back to bed and rest. Memento mori indeed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this to say that this has been one of the most difficult years of my life — and I know my life is not as challenging as many others — so if you feel any of this, then you are not alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite all this, I did manage to do a few things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"http://thecreativepenn.com/makealiving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-1024x536.png\" alt=\"How To Make A Living with your writing 3\" class=\"wp-image-32484\" width=\"367\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-1024x536.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-300x157.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder-768x402.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HowToMakeALiving3Preorder.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Joanna Penn — Books for authors</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my goals was to write <a href=\"http://thecreativepenn.com/makealiving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Make a Living with your Writing Third Edition</a> — which I did in the first quarter and narrated the audiobook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also intended to finish <em>How to Write a Novel,</em> but once again, I opened the Scrivener file several times and just couldn’t get on with it. I have some imposter syndrome around the topic, for sure. After all, Stephen King wrote a book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mBpTrc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">On Writing! </a>It’s also such a dauntingly large subject so I need to pick an angle, but it remains on the To Write list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-1024x275.png\" alt=\"The Relaxed Author\" class=\"wp-image-33539\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-1024x275.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-300x81.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage-768x206.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jo-Mark-Relaxed-montage.png 1146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The surprise book of the year was <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Relaxed Author,</a> which I co-wrote with Mark Leslie Lefebvre — and we both did the audiobook narration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sprang out of an interview conversation and then we had so many comments saying it was needed, that we went ahead and wrote the book. We both had to clear our schedules to write it, but I’m glad we did. <strong>Lots of you have said it’s been useful in a year when we all needed to relax more.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, I finished it just before getting Covid and you can listen to us talking about our process and what we learned about each other in <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/09/27/co-writing-the-relaxed-author/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">episode 575</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In foreign rights, I self-published <a href=\"http://mybook.to/BusinessPlanDE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Your Author Business Plan in German </a>and also licensed some more non-fiction <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3swosOt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">books for authors in French</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I intended to double down on selling direct which I have definitely achieved. There’s more I could do, but I sell ebooks and audiobooks every day from <a href=\"http://payhip.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payhip.com/thecreativepenn</a>. You get a good deal, and I get money in my bank account immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know many of you have used <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/selldirecttutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my tutorial on selling direct</a> to set up your own direct sales, so I’m pleased that’s becoming more of a trend for indies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Creative Penn Website</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2021, Google updated their algorithm around page speed and some other metrics, so I implemented a new theme and some technical backend things on TheCreativePenn.com, one of those tasks that you just have to do sporadically with what is now a 13-year-old site!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should now find it easier to search if you use the <a href=\"http://www.thecreativepenn.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Search Bar on the Start Here page</a> and there are more landing pages and resource pages for the most common things: <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/editors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">editors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/bookcoverdesign/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">book cover design</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tools for authors</a>, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run an author business, <strong>your website and email list are assets,</strong> just as much as your books. I frequently get offers for this site but of course, it’s not for sale. It is the hub for everything I do online, and it drives significant revenue — and importantly, I control it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to maintain our backlist books, but we also have to maintain our backlist website/s. So this was a business-critical task that just had to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage.jpg\" alt=\"The Creative Penn Podcast\" class=\"wp-image-32793\" width=\"229\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage.jpg 400w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PodcastHomePage-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Creative Penn Podcast</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been an epic year for The Creative Penn Podcast with weekly episodes as usual, plus a lot of extra in-between-isodes and futurist shows (69 episodes in 2021 in total).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to my corporate sponsors and to my patrons at <a href=\"http://patreon.com/thecreativepenn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">patreon.com/thecreativepenn</a> for continuing to support the show.

While many of you appreciated these episodes and found them interesting, others didn’t find them so palatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I have received more hate and negativity — through emails, comments, and social media — in the last few months than I have received in my entire author career over these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was even a moment when I thought I might separate out the futurist stuff into another private, paid podcast and website and never mention it again here, but my wonderful patrons — and many listeners by email and comments — helped me see that the information is worthwhile and important to keep sharing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Change is hard, but it’s also inevitable.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I started sharing my journey here in 2008 in the early days of ebooks, print on demand, and later digital audio and then streaming, and then all the other things. <strong>Technology will keep changing and will bring us more opportunity and inevitably more challenge</strong>. I’ll keep sharing what I learn and you can expect more futurist episodes — and application of the technology — in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>J.F. Penn — Thrillers, dark fantasy, crime, and horror</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I found it incredibly hard to write fiction this year, so it’s not been a stellar year for J.F. Penn! I have journaled a LOT but that is not for publication, at least not for right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://books2read.com/tombofrelics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"793\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tomb-of-relics.png\" alt=\"Tomb of Relics\" class=\"wp-image-33841\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tomb-of-relics.png 793w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tomb-of-relics-300x90.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tomb-of-relics-768x230.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of new creative works, I wrote <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/tomb-of-relics/\">Tomb of Relics</a> (previous working title, Day of the Martyr). It was a hard-won book — and turned out as a novella, not a full-length novel — because I am usually inspired to write by my travels, which clearly, didn’t happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(My conversation with <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/09/06/strengths-for-writers/\">Becca Syme in episode 572 on strengths</a> helped me understand why travel is so important for me.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote one new short story which I’ll publish in January (<em>Blood, Sweat, and Flame</em>), and edited and published a story I’ve been sitting on for a few years as it never seemed quite the right time to publish it — <a href=\"http://mybook.to/midwintersacrifice\">A Midwinter Sacrifice</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"http://mybook.to/midwintersacrifice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MidwinterSacrifice-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33842\" width=\"449\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MidwinterSacrifice-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MidwinterSacrifice-300x169.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MidwinterSacrifice-768x432.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MidwinterSacrifice-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MidwinterSacrifice.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But <strong>being an indie author is not just about producing new work, it’s also about making the most of your intellectual property assets, and being a good publisher.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year I started doing hardcovers through KDP Print, as well as Ingram. I also published the <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/mapwalkertrilogy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mapwalker Trilogy</a> in all the formats, and <a href=\"https://jfpenn.com/book/tree-of-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tree of Life</a> in audiobook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pulled the first three ARKANE thrillers out of ACX exclusivity and took them wide. Plus, I engaged Michaelbrent Collings to help with <a href=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/2021/12/06/improve-your-fiction-book-description/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my fiction book descriptions after his fantastic interview on the topic in episode 591</a>. I’m in the middle of updating all of that through the publishing eco-system. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Books and Travel</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Books and Travel Podcast</a> is now at 76 episodes and this year, I found solace in virtual escape and dreams of travel that the interviews provided me — and from the comments and emails, my listeners found that too. It is a podcast of love and still doesn’t bring me any direct income, because I haven’t written the travel books I intended to, but it has brought me happiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also using the site as a blog to share articles and pictures from places I travel, so you can read and see the <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pictures from the St Cuthbert’s Way,</a> even though I haven’t done a solo episode on it, or written the book yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like some virtual travel, or some musings on the deeper side of it all, just search for Books and Travel Podcast on your favourite app, or check out the backlist at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/listen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BooksAndTravel.page/listen</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jfpennauthor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"174\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-1024x174.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33839\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-1024x174.png 1024w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-300x51.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021-768x131.png 768w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Joanna-Penn-travel-2021.png 1382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Health, travel, walking&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In my 2021 goals, I said, “I’m expecting it to be at least a full pandemic year — from March 2020 to March 2021, but I am really hoping to be back in the world in the second half of this year. I'm planning trips to Portugal and Japan, as well as some more ultra-marathons and another walking pilgrimage in the north of England.&nbsp;My plan is to work hard in the earlier months so I can have more time off later in the year for some much-needed travel, family catch-ups, and book research trips.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hmm, well, once again, not really as expected</strong> — but we made the most of our beautiful country and I appreciate the UK as a holiday destination more than ever! We did the following:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/cycling-oxford-to-bath-cotswolds/\">Cycled from Oxford to Bath through the Cotswolds</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/south-west-coast-path-lyme-regis-to-seaton/\">Walked along the Jurassic Coast</a> and visited the gorgeous coastal town of Lyme Regis</li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CT45px3AkqY/\">Walked in Puzzle Wood</a>, part of the ancient Forest of Dean that inspired Tolkien’s Fangorn&nbsp;</li><li>I <a href=\"https://www.booksandtravel.page/st-cuthberts-way-lindisfarne/\">walked the St Cuthbert’s Way</a> from the borders of Scotland across Northumberland to Lindisfarne, Holy Island</li><li>After an incredible amount of stress — and a double dose of bureaucratic hell and quarantine difficulties — we made it to Auckland, New Zealand. It’s a family trip and not a holiday, since my mother-in-law is immune-compromised, so we can’t do much, but it is warm and there is sea and bush to walk beside.

I spent a lot of time on things that don’t bring in immediate revenue, but should add revenue streams in the future. I also said ‘no’ to many opportunities for income for mental health reasons, and just because it wasn’t interesting to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I want to continue with the experimentation in 2022, I do want to try and lift my income again, so more on that in my 2022 goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"979\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33843\" srcset=\"https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass.png 979w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass-300x93.png 300w, https://www.thecreativepenn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/This-too-shall-pass-768x238.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\" /><figcaption>This too shall pass.
